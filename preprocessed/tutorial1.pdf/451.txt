【PG】1A random event  is something that happens (an “event”) where you don’t know ahead of 
time what the outcome will be. Two examples are flipping a coin (you don’t know if it 
will come up heads or tails), and rolling a pair of dice (you don’t know what numbers 
will come up on the dice).

【PG】2Rolling an 11-sided die is different from rolling two 6-sided dice because, with an 
11-sided die, all numbers from 2 to 12 have an equal probability of coming up. With 
two 6-sided dice, some number s (totals of the two dice) will come up more often than 
others.

【PG】3Here are two ways to simulate rolling a die in Python:

【PG】and

【PG】4To represent a single card, we used an object.

【PG】5To represent a deck of cards, we used a list. Each item in the list was one card (an 
object).

【PG】my_data.write(name + "\n")
【PG】my_data.write(age + "\n")
【PG】my_data.write(color + "\n")
【PG】my_data.write(food)
【PG】my_data.close()

【PG】import pickle
【PG】name = raw_input("Enter your name: ")
【PG】age = raw_input("Enter your age: ")
【PG】color = raw_input("Enter your favorite color: ")
【PG】food = raw_input("Enter your favorite food: ")
【PG】my_list = [name, age, color, food]
【PG】pickle_file = open("my_pickle_file.pkl", 'w')
【PG】pickle.dump(my_list, pickle_file)
【PG】pickle_file.close()

【PG】import random
【PG】sides = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
【PG】die_1 = random.choice(sides)

【PG】import random
【PG】die_1 = random.randint(1, 6)
