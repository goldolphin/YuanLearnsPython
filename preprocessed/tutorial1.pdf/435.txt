1Here is a program to print a multiplication table of the user’s choice using a for loop:
2Here is the same multiplication table using a while loop:
3Here is the multiplication table with a user-defined range: 
Notice in the for line that the second thing in range()  includes a variable, not just a 
number. We will learn more about that in chapter 11.

1Here’s a sample of some comments I would add to the temperature-conversion program:
# program to print multiplication table up to 10
number = int(raw_input('Which table would you like? '))print 'Here is your table:'
for i in range(1, 11):
    print number, 'x', i, '=', number * i

【PG】# program to print mult table (while loop)
number = int(raw_input('Which table would you like? '))
print 'Here is your table:'
i = 1while i <= 10:
    print number, 'times', i, '=', number * i
    i = i + 1

【PG】# program to print multiplication table
# user inputs how high they want it to gonumber = int(raw_input('Which table would you like? '))
limit = int(raw_input('How high would you like it to go? 
'))
print 'Here is your table:'for i in range(1, limit + 1):                                          
    print number, 'times', i, '=', number * i
# tempconv1.py
# program to convert a Fahrenheit temperature to CelsiusFahr = 75
Cel = (Fahr – 32) * 5.0 / 9   #decimal division, not integer
print
"Fahrenheit = ", Fahr, "Celsius = ", Cel

【PG】2. 下面的程序使用 while循环打印同一个乘法表：

Cel = (Fahr – 32) * 5.0 / 9   #decimal division, not integer
print
"Fahrenheit = ", Fahr, "Celsius = ", Cel

【PG】3. 下面的程序会根据用户定义的范围打印乘法表：
 # program to print multiplication table
# user inputs how high they want it to go
number = int(raw_input('Which table would you like? '))
limit = int(raw_input('How high would you like it to go? '))
print 'Here is your table:'
for i in range(1, limit + 1):                                          
    print number, 'times', i, '=', number * i
注意for代码行中 range() 的第二项包含一个变量， 而不是一个数。 我们将在第 11章介绍有关的更多内容。

【PG】1. 下面是我为温度转换程序增加的一些注释：
 # tempconv1.py
# program to convert a Fahrenheit temperature to CelsiusFahr = 75
Cel = (Fahr – 32) * 5.0 / 9   #decimal division, not integer 
print“Fahrenheit = ”, Fahr, “ Celsius = ”, Cel
