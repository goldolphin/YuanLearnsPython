【PG】102　　第 10章　游戏时间到了

【PG】代码清单 10-1的代码已经放在 \examples\skier 文件夹中， 所以如果你键入的程序无法执行， 或者不想完全自己键入， 也可以使用这个文件。 不过不管你是否相信，与简单地打开和查看代码清单相比，亲手键入这些代码会让你有更多收获。

【PG】在后面的几章 ，我们将会学习用于 Skier中的所有关键字和技术。 本书第 25章将用一整章来详细解释 Skier程 序的工作原理。 但是现在，你只需要键入这个程序，试着运行看看。

【PG】86 Hello World!
for i in range (1, 6):
    print
    print 'i =', i,
    print 'Hello, how',    if i == 3:
        continue
    print 'are you today?'
If we run this program, the output looks like this:

Notice that, the third time through the loop (when i == 3 ), the body of the loop didn’t 
finish—it jumped ahead to the next iteration ( i == 4 ). That was the continue  statement 
at work. It works the same way in while  loops.

【PG】Bailing out— break
What if we want to jump out of the loop completely—never finish counting, or give up waiting for the end condition? The break  statement does that.

Let’s change only line 6 of listing 8.9, replacing continue  with break , and rerun the program to see what happens.

This time, the loop didn’t just skip the rest of iteration 3; it stopped altogether. That’s what 
break  does. It works the same way in while  loops. 

【PG】I should tell you that some people think using break  and continue  is a bad idea. Personally, I don’t think they’re bad, but I rarely use them. I thought I’d tell you about break  and continue  just in case you ever need them. Listing 8.9 Using continue  in a loop

>>> ================== RESTART ==================
>>> 
i = 1 Hello how are you today?i = 2 Hello how are you today?
i = 3 Hello how
i = 4 Hello how are you today?
i = 5 Hello how are you today?
>>> ================== RESTART ==================
>>> 
i = 1 Hello how are you today?
i = 2 Hello how are you today?
i = 3 Hello how

【PG】动手试一试
这一章你要做的只是键入这个 Skier程序（代码清单 10-1） ，再运行试试看。 如果运行时遇到错误，看看错误消息，试着找出错误究竟出现在哪里。

祝你好运！
