【PG】7.9　使用 not　　
7370 Hello World!
You can put more than two 
conditions together with and: 
If there are more than two conditions, all the conditions have to be true for the if state-
ment to be true. 
There are other ways of combining conditions too. 

Using “or”
The or keyword is also used to put conditions together. If you use or, the block is executed 
if any of the conditions are true. 

Using “not”
You can also flip around a comparison to mean the opposite, using not.
age = float(raw_input("Enter your age: "))
grade = int(raw_input("Enter your grade: "))
color = raw_input("Enter your favorite color: ")
if age >= 8 and grade >= 3 and color == "green":
    print "You are allowed to play this game."
else:    
    print "Sorry, you can’t play the game."

color = raw_input("Enter your favorite color: ")
if color == "red" or color == "blue" or color == 
"green":
    print "You are allowed to play this game."
else:    
    print "Sorry, you can’t play the game."

color = “red” 
color = “blue”
True True TrueFalse
color = “green”
False False
You can play!
if or or (Get here if anycondition is true)

age = float(raw_input("Enter your age: "))
if not (age < 8):
    print "You are allowed to play this game."
else:
    print "Sorry, you can’t play the game."

如果有两个以上的条件，所有条件都必须为真，这个 if语句才能为真。
还有其他方法来结合多个条件。

【PG】7.8　使用 or
or关键字也是用来把多个条件放在一起。 如果使用 or，只要任意一个条件为
真，就会执行代码块。

color = raw_input("Enter your favorite color: ")
if color == "red" or color == "blue" or color == "green":
    print "You are allowed to play this game. "
else:    
    print "Sorry, you can't play the game. "

【PG】7.9　使用 not
还可以用not把比较倒过来，表示相反的逻辑。

color = raw_input("Enter your favorite color: ")
if color == "red" or color == "blue" or color == "green":    
    print "You are allowed to play this game."
else:
    print "Sorry, you can't play the game."
