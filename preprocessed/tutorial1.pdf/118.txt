【PG】3. 向乘法表程序中再加点东西。询问用户想要的乘法表之后，再问问用户希望最大乘到几。输出应当如下所示：88 Hello World!

【PG】2 You probably used a for loop in your program for question #1. That’s how most people would do it. But just for practice, try doing the same thing with a while loop. Or if you used a while loop in question #1, try it with a for loop.

【PG】3 Add something else to the multiplication table program. After asking which table the user wants, ask her how high the table should go. The output should look like this:
You can do this with the for loop version of the program, the while  loop version, or both.W hich multiplication table would you like?
How high do you want to go?
12
Here's your table:
7 x 1 = 7
7 x 2 = 14
7 x 3 = 217 x 4 = 28
7 x 5 = 35
7 x 6 = 427 x 7 = 49
7 x 8 = 56
7 x 9 = 637 x 10 = 70
7 x 11 = 77
7 x 12 = 84

【PG】可以用for循环或者while循环的版本来完成，或者两种做法都试试看。图灵社区会员 FreeLink 专享 尊重版权
