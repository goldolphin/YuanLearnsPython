# program to check age and gender of soccer players
# accept girls who are 10 to 12 years old
gender = raw_input("Are you male or female? ('m' or 'f') ")
if gender  == 'f':    age = int(raw_input('What is your age? '))
    if age >= 10 and age <= 12:

else:    print 'Only girls are allowed on this team.'

if number > 30  and  number <= 40:    print 'The number is between 30 and 40'
if 30 < number <= 40:    print "The number is between 30 and 40"
if answer == 'Q' or answer == 'q':
    print "you typed a 'Q' "
