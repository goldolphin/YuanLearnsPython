【PG】86 Hello World!

【PG】for i in range (1, 6):
    print
    print 'i =', i,
    print 'Hello, how',    if i == 3:
        continue
    print 'are you today?'
If we run this program, 
the output looks like this:

【PG】Notice that, the third time through the loop (when i == 3 ), the body of the loop didn’t 
【PG】finish—it jumped ahead to the next iteration ( i == 4 ). That was the continue  statement 
【PG】at work. It works the same way in while  loops.

【PG】Bailing out— break
What if we want to jump out of the loop co mpletely—never finish counting, or give up 
waiting for the end condition? The break  statement does that.

【PG】Let’s change only line 6 of listing 8.9, replacing continue  with break , and rerun the program 
【PG】to see what happens.

【PG】This time, the loop didn’t just skip the rest of  iteration 3; it stopped altogether. That’s what 
【PG】break  does. It works the same way in while  loops. 

【PG】I should tell you that some people think using break  and continue  is a bad idea. Personally, 
I don’t think they’re bad, but I rarely use them. I thought I’d tell you about break  and 
continue  just in case you ever need them. Listing 8.9 Using continue  in a loop

【PG】>>> ================== RESTART ==================
>>> 
i = 1 Hello how are you today?i = 2 Hello how are you today?
i = 3 Hello how
i = 4 Hello how are you today?
i = 5 Hello how are you today?
>>> ================== RESTART ==================
>>> 
i = 1 Hello how are you today?
i = 2 Hello how are you today?
i = 3 Hello how
