4Here is a simple password program:
Chapter 8: Loop the Loop
Test your knowledge
1The loop would run 5 times.
2The loop would run 3 times, and the values would be as follows: i = 1, i = 3, i = 5.
3range(1, 8)  would give you [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] .
4range(8)  would give you [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] .
5range(2, 9, 2)  would give you [2, 4, 6, 8] .
6range (10, 0, -2)  would give you  [10, 8, 6, 4, 2] .
7You use continue  to stop the current iteration of a loop and jump ahead to the next 
iteration.
8A while  loop ends when the condition being tested is false .

【PG】# program to check if you need gas.
# Next station is 200 km away
tank_size = int(raw_input('How big is your tank (liters)? '))
full = int(raw_input ('How full is your tank (eg. 50 for half full)?'))
mileage = int(raw_input ('What is your gas mileage (km per liter)? '))
range = tank_size * (full / 100.0) * mileage
print 'You can go another', range, 'km.'
print 'The next gas station is 200km away.'
if range <= 200:
    print 'GET GAS NOW!'
else:
    print 'You can wait for the next station.'

【PG】password  = "bigsecret"
guess  = raw_input("Enter your password: ")
if guess == password:
    print "Password correct.  Welcome"    # put the rest of the code for your program here
else:
    print "Password incorrect.  Goodbye"
range = tank_size * (full / 100.0) * mileage
range = (tank_size - 5) * (full / 100.0) * mileage 
要增加一个 5公升的缓冲区，需要把这行代码：
