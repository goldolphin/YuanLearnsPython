【PG】Listing 23.4 isn’t a complete program. It’s just the class definition for our Card  class. Because 
this is something we could use over and over in different programs, maybe we should make 
it a module . Save the code in listing 23.4 as cards.py. 
【PG】The error checking in the code B makes sure that rank_id  and suit_id  are in range and 
that they are integers. If they aren’t, you would see something like “7 of SuitError” or “RankError of Clubs” when displaying the card in a program.

【PG】Now we need to make some instances of cards— in fact, a whole deck would be nice! To test 
our 
Card  class, let’s make a program to create a deck of 52 cards and then pick 5 cards at 
random and display their attributes. Li sting 23.5 has some code for that. 
import random
from cards import Card

deck = [] 
for suit_id in range(1, 5): 
    for rank_id in range(1, 14):
        deck.append(Card(suit_id, rank_id))
        
hand = []
for cards in range(0, 5):
    a = random.choice(deck)    
    hand.append(a)
    deck.remove(a)
print    
for card in hand:
    print card.short_name, '=' ,card.long_name, "  Value:", card.value

【PG】The inner loop goes through each card in the suit, and the outer loop goes through each 
suit B (13 cards * 4 suits = 52 cards). Then the code picks five cards from the deck and puts 
them in a hand C. It also removes the cards from the deck.

【PG】If you run the code in listing 23.5, you should get something like this:
【PG】If you run it again, you should get five different cards. And no matter how many times you 
run it, you should never get the same card twice in one hand. 

【PG】So now we can make a deck of cards and randomly draw cards from it to add them to a 
hand. It sounds like we have the basic things we need to make a card game! In the next section, we’ll make a card game that you can play against the computer.

【PG】Crazy Eights
　　You might have heard of a card game called “Crazy Eights.” You might even have played it. 
One thing about card games on the computer is that it’s difficult to have multiple 
players. That’s because, in most card games, you’re not supposed to see the 
other players’ cards. If everyone is looking at the same computer, everybody will see everyone else’s cards. So the best 
solution is to make a solitaire version— where you play against the computer.
