【PG】第 7章　判断再判断

【PG】You’re on a long car trip and arrive at a gas station. It’s 200 km to the next station. 
Write a program to figure out if you need to  buy gas here, or if you can wait for the 
next station.
The program should ask these questions:
�How big is your tank, in liters?
�How full is your tank (in percent—for example, half full = 50)?
�How many km per liter does your car get?
The output should look something like this:
Size of tank:  60
percent full:  40
km per liter:  10
You can go another 240 km
The next gas station is 200 km away
You can wait for the next station.
Bonus: Include a 5 liter buffer in your prog ram, in case the fuel gauge isn’t accurate.

【PG】4Make a program where the user has to enter a secret password to use the program. 
You’ll know the password, of course (because  it’ll be in your code). But your friends 
will either have to ask you, guess the password, or learn enough Python to look at the 
code and figure it out!
The program can be anything you want, including one you have already written, or 
just a simple one that displays a message like “You’re in!” when he enters the right 
password.

【PG】额外提示：程序中包含一个 5升的缓冲区，以防油表不准。

【PG】4.  建立一个程序， 用户必须输入密码才能使用这个程序。 你当然知道密码（ 因为
它会写在你的代码中 ） 。不过，你 的朋友要得到这个密码就必须问你或者直接
猜，也可以学习足够的 Python知识查看代码来找出密码 ！
对程序没什么要求， 可 以是你已经编写的程序， 也可以是一个非常简单的程
序，只在用户输入正确的口令时显示一条“You ’re in! ”之类的消息。
