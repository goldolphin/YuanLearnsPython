CHAPTER  11 Nested and Variable Loops

We can even have nested-nested loops (or double-nested loops). That would look like the 
ones in listing 11.3.

numBlocks = int(raw_input ('How many blocks of stars do you want? '))
numLines = int(raw_input ('How many lines in each block? '))
numStars = int(raw_input ('How many stars per line? '))
for block in range(0, numBlocks):    
    for line in range(0, numLines):
        for star in range(0, numStars): 
            print '*',        
        print
    print

【PG】Here’s the output:

We say the loop is nested “three deep. ”

【PG】Even more variable nested loops

Listing 11.4 shows a trickier version of the program from listing 11.3.

numBlocks = int(raw_input('How many blocks of stars do you want? '))
for block in range(1, numBlocks + 1):    
    for line in range(1, block * 2 ): 
        for star in range(1, (block + line) * 2):
            print '*',        
        print
    print

Listing 11.3 Blocks of stars with double-nested loops

Listing 11.4 A trickier version of blocks of stars

>>> ======================= RESTART =======================
>>>
How many blocks of stars do you want? 3
How many lines of stars in each block? 4
How many stars per line? 8

【PG】Formulas for number of lines and stars

numBlocks = int(raw_input ('How many blocks of stars do you want? ') )
numLines = int(raw_input ('How many lines in each block? ') )
numStars = int(raw_input ('How many stars per line? ') )
for block in range(0, numBlocks) :
    for line in range(0, numLines) :
        for star in range(0, numStars):  
            print '*' ,
        print
    print
【PG】会得到下面的输出：
