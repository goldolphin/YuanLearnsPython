【PG】1.8　你的第二个程序　　 13

【PG】12 Hello World!
if guess == secret:                        
    print "Avast! Ye got it!  Found my secret, ye did!"
else:
    print "No more guesses!  Better luck next time, matey!"    
print "The secret number was", secret

When you are typing it in, notice the indenting of the lines after the while instruction, and 
the extra indenting of the lines after if and elif . Also notice the colons at the ends of some 
of the lines. If you type the colon in the correct place, the editor will help you by indenting 
the next line for you.

Once you’ve saved it, run it using Run > Run Module , just like you did for the first program. 
Try playing it and see what happens. Here is a sample of when I ran it:
It took me five guesses to get the secret number, which turned out to be 12.

We will be learning all about the while , if, else , elif , and 
input  instructions in the next few chapters. But you can 
probably already get the basic idea of how this program 
works:
�The secret number is randomly picked by the program. 
�The user inputs his guesses. 
�The program keeps checking the guess against the 
secret number: is it higher or lower? 
�The user keeps trying until he guesses the number or runs out of turns.
�When the guess matches the secret number, the player 
wins.

【PG】我猜了 5次才猜到这个秘密数，也就是 12。

后面几章我们会学习有关 while、if、else、elif和input指令
