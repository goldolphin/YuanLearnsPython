【PG】8.8　跳出循环——break 和continue　　 91
【PG】用continue 跳到下一次迭代。
【PG】用break跳出循环。
【PG】测试题
【PG】1. 下面的循环会运行多少次？
【PG】87  CHAPTER  8 Loop the Loop
【PG】What did you learn?
【PG】In this chapter, you learned about
【PG】�for loops (also called counting loops).
【PG】�the range()  function—a shortcut for counting loops.
【PG】�different step sizes for range() .
【PG】�while  loops (also called conditional loops).
【PG】�skipping to the next iteration with continue .
【PG】�jumping out of a loop with break .
【PG】Test your knowledge
【PG】1How many times would the following loop run?
【PG】2How many times would the following loop run? 
【PG】And what would the values of i be for each loop?
【PG】3What list of numbers would range (1, 8)  give you?
【PG】4What list of numbers would range (8)  give you?
【PG】5What list of numbers would range (2, 9, 2)  give you?
【PG】6What list of numbers would range (10, 0, -2)  give you?
【PG】7What keyword do you use to stop the current iteration of a loop and jump ahead to 
【PG】the next iteration?
【PG】8When does a while  loop end?
【PG】Try it out
【PG】1Write a program to print a multiplication tabl e (a times table). At the start, it should 
【PG】ask the user which table to print. The ou tput should look something like this:
【PG】for i in range (1, 6):
【PG】    print 'Hi, Warren'
【PG】for i in range (1, 6, 2):
【PG】    print 'Hi, Warren'
【PG】Which multiplication table would you like?
【PG】5Here's your table:
【PG】5 x 1 = 5
【PG】5 x 2 = 10
【PG】5 x 3 = 15
【PG】5 x 4 = 20
【PG】5 x 5 = 25
【PG】5 x 6 = 30
【PG】5 x 7 = 35
【PG】5 x 8 = 40
【PG】5 x 9 = 45
【PG】5 x 10 = 50
【PG】2. 下面的循环会运行多少次？每次循环时 i的值是什么？

【PG】3. range(1, 8)  会给出一个怎样的数字列表？
【PG】4. range(8)  会给出一个怎样的数字列表？
【PG】5. range(2, 9, 2)  会给出一个怎样的数字列表？
【PG】6. range(10, 0, -2)  会给出一个怎样的数字列表？
【PG】7. 使用哪个关键字停止循环的当前迭代，提前跳到下一次迭代？
【PG】8. while循环什么时候结束？
【PG】动手试一试
【PG】1.  编写一个程序， 显示一个乘法表。 开始时要询问用户显示哪个数的乘法表。
【PG】输出应该如下所示：

【PG】5 x 1 = 5
【PG】5 x 2 = 10
【PG】5 x 3 = 15

【PG】5 x 7 = 35
【PG】5 x 8 = 40
【PG】5 x 9 = 45
【PG】5 x 10 = 50
【PG】2.  完成第 1题的程序时你可能使用了 for循环。大多数人都会这么做。 不过，
【PG】可以再做个练习， 试 着用while循环完成同样的工作。 或者如果你在第 1题
【PG】中使用了while循环，现在可以试着用 for循环来完成。
