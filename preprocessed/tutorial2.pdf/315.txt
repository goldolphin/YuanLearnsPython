【PG】291 CHAPTER  20 More GUIs
I tried this on my
Mac, and when I press the
Option  key, which also says Alt on
it, I don’t see any underlined or
highlighted characters in
the menu items. 
Are there
menu hotkeys in
Mac OS X?

【PG】We need to decide what hotkeys to use for the Convert  menu items. Let’s use C for Convert , 
C for Celsius to Fahrenheit, and F for Fahrenheit to Celsius. So we have &Convert , &C to F
and &F to C . The hotkey combinations are Alt-C-C  (for Celsius to Fahrenheit) and Alt-C-F
(for Fahrenheit to Celsius).

【PG】Once you define the hotkeys in Qt Designer, there’s nothing else to do—no new code to 
write. PyQt and the operating system take care of underlining the hotkey and handling the 
keyboard input. Just save your UI file. You could save it under a different name, like 
tempconv_menu_hotkeys.ui . If you do, be sure you change the third line in listing 20.4 to 
load that UI file:

【PG】The short answer is “no. ” Because 
all Macs have come with a mouse (or 
touchpad) since day one, the Mac OS assumes you’ll use the 
mouse to operate the menus. There is no keyboard shortcut or 
hotkey system for menu items on the Mac OS. There are keyboard 
shortcuts for many functions, and some of them correspond to 
menu items. But you can’t directly operate the menu system with hotkeys the way you 
can in Windows.

【PG】That’s it for the temperature-conversion GUI. In chapter 22, we’ll use PyQt to make a version 
of the Hangman game.
