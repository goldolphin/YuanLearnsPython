【PG】Time for another game—PyP ong
In this section, we’ll put together some of the things we have learned—including sprites, 
collision detection, and events—to make a simple paddle-and-ball game, similar to Pong.
We’ll start with a simple one-player version. Our game will need 
■A ball to bounce around
■A paddle to hit the ball with
■A way to control the paddle
■A way to keep score and display the score in the window
■A way to keep track of “lives”—how many turns you get
We’ll cover each of these requirements one by one as we build our program.
