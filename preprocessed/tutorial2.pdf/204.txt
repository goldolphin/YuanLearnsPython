【PG】180 Hello World!

【PG】That’s it! You have just created a module! Your module has one function in it, the c_to_f()
function, which converts a temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

【PG】Next, we’ll use my_module.py  in another program. How do we use modules? In order to use something that is in a module, you first have to tell Python which modules you want to use. The Python keyword that lets you include other modules in your program 
is import . You use it like this:

【PG】Let’s write a program that uses the module we just wrote. We’re going to use the c_to_f()
function to do a temperature conversion. You already saw how to use a function and pass parameters (or arguments) to it. The only difference here is that the function will be in a separate file from our main program, so we’ll have to use import . The program in the next listing uses the module we just wrote, my_module.py .

【PG】impor t my_module            
celsius = floa t(raw_inpu t ("Enter a tempera ture in Celsius: " ))
fahrenhei t = c_ to_f(celsius)
prin t "Tha t's ", fahrenhei t, " degrees Fahrenhei t"

【PG】Create a new IDLE editor window, and type in this program. Save it as modular.py , and then run it to see what happens. You will need to save it in the same folder (or directory) as my_module.py . Did it work? You should have seen something like this:

【PG】impor t my_module

【PG】my_module contains the c_to_f() function
