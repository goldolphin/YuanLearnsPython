【PG】CHAPTER  15 Modules
The other way the principal could get the correct Shawn is to go to the doorway of your 
class and say, “Shawn, would you please come with me. ” There would be only one Shawn 
listening, and she would get the right one. In that case, the namespace would be just one 
classroom, not the whole school.

【PG】In general terms, programmers refer to smaller namespaces (like your classroom) as local
namespaces and larger ones (like the whole school) as global  namespaces.

Let’s assume that there’s nobody named Fred in 
your school, John Young School. If the principal 
goes on the public address system and asks for 
Fred, she won’t get anyone. Now imagine that 
another school down the road, Stephen Leacock 
School, is having some repairs done, so one of 
their classes moves into a portable at your 
school. 

【PG】In that class, there’s a student named 
Fred. But that portable isn’t connected to the 
public address system yet. If the principal calls 
for Fred, she won’t get anybody. But if she 
connects the new portable to the public address 
system and then calls for Fred, she will get the 
Fred from Stephen Leacock School.
Shawn, 
would you please 
come with me.
Will Fred 
please come 
to the office!
