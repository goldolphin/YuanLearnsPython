【PG】In listing 14.1, we have a class definition for a ball with one method: bounce() . But what 
about attributes? Well, attributes don’t really belong to the class, they belong to each 
instance. That’s because each instance can have different attributes. 

【PG】There are a couple of ways you can set the instance attributes. You’ll see both ways in the 
following sections.
Creating an instance of an object
As we mentioned before, a class definition isn’t an object. It’s just the blueprints. Now let’s 
build a house. 
If we want to create an instance  of a Ball , we do it like this:
Our ball does not have any attributes yet, so let’s give it some:
This is one of the ways to define attributes for the object. You’ll see the other way in the 
next section.

【PG】Now, let’s try out one of the methods. Here’s how we’d use the bounce()  method:
Let’s put this all together into a program, with some print  statements to see what’s 
going on.Listing 14.1 Creating a simple Ball  class
myBall = Ball()
myBall.direc tion = "down"
myBall.color = "green"
myBall.size = "small"
myBall.bounce()This tells Python we’re 
making a class
