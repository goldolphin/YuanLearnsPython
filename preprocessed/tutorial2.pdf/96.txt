【PG】72 Hello World! 

【PG】Move on.  If you don’t put anything else after the if block, the program will continue on 
to the next line of code (if there is one) or will end (if there is no more code).
Try making a program with the code above by adding a line at the beginning to input a 
number:
Remember to save the file (you pick the name this time), and then run it. Try it a few times 
with different inputs to see what you get.

【PG】Testing for more than one condition
What if you want to test for more than one thing? Let’s say we made a game that was for 
eight-year-olds and up, and we want to make sure the player is in at least third grade. There 
are two conditions to meet. Here is one way we could test for both conditions:
Notice that the first print  line is indented eight spaces, not just four spaces. That’s because 
each if needs its own block, so each one has its own indenting.answer = floa t(raw_inpu t ("Enter a number from 1 to 15"))
age = floa t(raw_inpu t("Enter your age: " ))
grade = int(raw_inpu t("Enter your grade: " ))
if age >= 8:
    if grade >= 3:
        prin t "You can play this game."
else:
    prin t "Sorry, you can' t play the game."
