【PG】Collecting Things Together—
Lists and Dictionaries
We’ve seen that Python can store things in its memory and retrieve them, using names. So 
far, we have stored strings  and numbers  (both integers  and floats ). Sometimes it’s useful to 
store a bunch of things together in a kind of group or collection . Then you can do things to 
the whole collection at once and keep track of groups of things more easily. One of the kinds 
of collections is a list, and another is a dictionary . In this chapter, we’re going to learn 
about lists and dictionaries—what they are and how to create, modify, and use them. 

【PG】Lists are very useful, and they’re used in many, many programs. We’ll use a lot of them in
the examples in upcoming chapters when we start doing graphics and game programming,
because the many graphical objects in a game are often stored in a list.

【PG】What’s a list?
If I asked you to make a list of the members of your family, you might write something like this:
In Python, you’d write this:
family = [ 'Mom', 'Dad', 'Junior' , 'Baby']
