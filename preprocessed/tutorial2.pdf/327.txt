【PG】303 CHAPTER  21 Print Formatting and Strings

【PG】How do we print a percent sign?
You might be wondering, because the percent sign (%) is a special character for format 
strings, how you make a % sign print?
Well, sometimes Python is smart enough to figure out when you’re using a % sign to start a 
format string and when you just want to print one. Try this:
In this case, there wasn’t a second % outside the string, and there was no variable to format, 
so Python assumed that the % was just another character in your string.

【PG】But if you are printing with format strings and you want to print a percent sign, you use 
two percent signs, just like you used two backslashes to print a backslash. We say the first 
percent sign is escaping  the second percent sign, just like in the Word Box earlier in this 
chapter:
The first % starts the format string. The two %% together tell Python that you actually want to 
print a % character. Then you have the % outside the quotes that tells Python the variable 
you want to print is coming next.

【PG】More than one format string
What if you want to put more than one format string in a single print  statement? Here’s 
how you do that:
You can put as many format strings as you want in the print  statement and then a tuple 
of variables you want to print. Remember that a tuple is like a list, except it uses round 
brackets instead of square ones, and a tuple is immutable. This is one instance where 
Python is picky—you have to use a tuple; you can’t use a list. The only exception is when 
you have just a single variable to format; then it doesn’t need to be in a tuple. (You saw that 
in most of our examples.) Make sure the number of format strings (inside the quotes) and 
the number of variables (outside the quotes) matches, or you’ll get an error message. 

>>> prin t 'I go t 90% on my ma th test!'
I go t 90% on my ma th test!
>>> ma th = 75.4
>>> prin t 'I go t %.1f%% on my ma th test' % ma th
I go t 75.4% on my ma th test
>>> ma th = 75.4
>>> science = 82.1
>>> prin t 'I go t %.1f in ma th and %.1f in science' % (ma th, science)
