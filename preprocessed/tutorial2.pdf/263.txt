【PG】239 CHAPTER  18 A New Kind of Input—Events
in Pygame to make it generate multiple KEYDOWN  events if a key is held down. This is known as 
key repeat . You tell it how long to wait before it starts repeating, and how often to repeat. The 
values are in milliseconds (thousandths of a second). It looks like this:
The delay  value tells Pygame how long to wait before starting to repeat, and the interval
value tells Pygame how fast the key should repeat—in other words, how long between each 
KEYDOWN  event.

【PG】Try adding this to listing 18.2 (somewhere after pygame.init , but before the while  loop) to 
see how it changes the behavior of the program.

【PG】Event names and key names
When we were looking for the up and down arrow keys being pressed, we looked for the
KEYDOWN  event type and the K_UP  and K_DOWN  key names. What other events are available? 
What are the names of the other keys? 
There are quite a lot of them, so I won't list them all here. But they're on the Pygame web site.
You can find the list of events in the event section of the Pygame documentation:
www.pygame.org/docs/ref/event.html
The list of key names is in the key section:
www.pygame.org/docs/ref/key.html

【PG】Here are a few of the common events you’ll use:
■QUIT  
■KEYDOWN  
■KEYUP  
■MOUSEMOTION  
■MOUSEBUTTONUP  
■MOUSEBUTTONDOWN  
Pygame also has names for each key that can be pressed. You saw the up arrow and down 
arrow, K_UP  and K_DOWN . You’ll see some of the other key names as we go along, but they all 
start with K_ followed by the name of the key, like this:
■K_a, K_b, and so on (for letter keys)
■K_SPACE 
■K_ESCAPE 
and so on. delay = 100
interval = 50
pygame.key.se t_repea t(delay, in terval)
