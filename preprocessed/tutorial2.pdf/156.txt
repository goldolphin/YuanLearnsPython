【PG】132 Hello World!

【PG】You can, of course, move the new tag to a whole new list, like this: That’s the same thing we did with strings and numbers in chapter 2. This means that, if you really want to make a copy  of a list, you need to do something differ - ent from new = original . The easiest way to do this is to use slice notation, like I did above: new = original[:] . This means “copy everything in the list, from the first item to the last  item. ” Then you get this: There are now two separate lists. We made a copy of the original and called it new. Now if we sort one list, the other one won’t be sorted.

【PG】Another way to sort— sorted() There is another way to get a sorted copy of a list without changing the order of the origi - nal list. Python has a function called sorted()  for that purpose. It works like this: The sorted()  function gives you a sorted copy  of the original list.>>> original = [5, 2, 3, 1, 4] >>> newer = sorted(original) >>> prin t original [5, 2, 3, 1, 4] >>> prin t newer [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

【PG】original = [5,2,3,1,4] 
new = original original
