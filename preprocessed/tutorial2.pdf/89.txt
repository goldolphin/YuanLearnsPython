【PG】Chapter 7
Decisions, Decisions

In the first few chapters, we saw some of the basic building blocks of a program. We can 
now make a program with input , processing,  and output . We can even make our input and 
output a little fancier by using a GUI. We can assign the input to a variable, so we can use it 
later, and we can use some math to process it. Now we’re going to start looking at ways to 
control what the program does. 

【PG】Testing, testing

Programs need to be able to do different things based on their input. Here are a few 
examples: 
■If Tim got the right answer, add 1 point to his score.
■If Jane hit the alien, make an explosion sound.
■If the file isn’t there, display an error message.

To make decisions, programs check (do a test)  to see if a certain condition  is true or not. In 
the first example above, the condition is “got the right answer. ”
Python has only a few ways to test something, and there are only two possible answers for 
each test: true  or false .
