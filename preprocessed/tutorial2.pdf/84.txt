60 Hello World!
The same thing happened to me. But that big choice box didn’t fit very well in this book. So 
I cheated a bit! I modified easygui.py  to let me make the choice box smaller so it would look 
nice in this book. It’s not something you need to do, but if you really want to, here are the 
steps. I warn you, it’s a bit complicated!
1Find the section in the easygui.py  file that starts with def __choicebox  (around line 
934 in my version of easygui.py ). Remember that most editors show you the code line 
numbers somewhere near the bottom of the window.
2About 30 lines down from that (around line 970), you’ll see some lines that look like this:
Change the 0.8 to 0.4 and the 0.5 to 0.25. Save the changes to easygui.py . The next
time you run the program, the choice box window will be smaller.

Text input
The examples in this chapter have let the user pick from a set of choices that you, as the 
programmer, provided. What if you want something more like raw_input() , where the user 
can type in text? That way, she can enter any flavor she wants. EasyGui has something 
called an enter box  (enterbox ) to do just that. Try the program in the following listing.
impor t easygui
flavor = easygui.en terbox("Wha t is your favori te ice cream flavor?" )
easygui.msgbox ( "You en tered " + flavor)
When you run it, you should see 
something like this:
And then, when you type in your favorite flavor and click OK, it’ll be displayed in the 
message box, just like before.
This is just like raw_input() . It gets text (a string) from the user.root_wid th = int((screen_wid th * 0.8))
root_heigh t = int((screen_heigh t * 0.5))
