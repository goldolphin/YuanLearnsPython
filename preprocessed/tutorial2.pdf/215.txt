【PG】191 CHAPTER  16 Graphics
Run the listing, and you should see a Pygame window that works properly and closes when 
you try to close it.

【PG】How exactly does the code in that while  loop work? It uses the Pygame event loop . But we’re 
going to save that topic for chapter 18, where we talk all about events in Pygame.

【PG】Drawing in the window
Now we have a Pygame window that stays open until we close it—and closes gracefully 
when we do. The [640, 480] in the third line of listing 16.2 is the size of our window: 
640 pixels wide by 480 pixels high. Let’s start drawing some graphics in there. Change your 
program so it looks like this.

impor t pygame, sys
pygame.ini t()
screen = pygame.display.se t_mode([640,480])
screen.fill([255,255,255])               
pygame.draw.circle(screen, [255,0,0],[100,100], 30, 0) 
pygame.display.flip()   

【PG】running = True
while running:
    for even t in pygame.even t.get():
        if even t.type == pygame.QUIT: 
            running = False
pygame.qui t()
