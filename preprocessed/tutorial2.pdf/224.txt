【PG】When you run this, you’ll get something that looks different every time. If you get a result that looks really nice, give it a fancy title like “Voice of the Machine” and see if you can sell it to your local art gallery!

【PG】Individual pixels
Sometimes you don’t want to draw a circle or rectangle, but you want to draw individual dots or pixels. Maybe you’re creating a math program and want to draw a sine wave, for example. Listing 16.6 Modern art with color
Don’t worry about how this line works for now
Don't worry if you don't know what a sine wave is. For the purposes of this chapter, it is just a wavy shape.
Also don't worry about the math formulas in the next few example programs. Just type them in as they appear in the listings. They are just a way to get a wavy shape that is a nice size to fill our Pygame window.

【PG】Hey, mon!
Them there sine waves usually be used for sound .
Like in music.  
Me? I prefer 
makin’ music on de 
waves of de 
ocean.
