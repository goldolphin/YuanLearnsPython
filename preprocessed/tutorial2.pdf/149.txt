【PG】125 CHAPTER  12 Collecting Things Together—Lists and Dictionaries

【PG】Notice that the letters are not in order. That’s because append()  adds the item to the end of 
the list. If you want the items in order, you’ll have to sort them. We’ll get to sorting very soon.

【PG】Extending the list: extend()
extend()  adds several items to the end of a list:
Notice that what’s inside the round brackets of the extend()  method is a list. A list has 
square brackets, so for extend() , you could have both round and square brackets.
Everything in the list you give to extend()  gets added to the end of the original list.

【PG】Inserting an item: insert()
insert()  adds a single item somewhere in the list. You tell it at what position in the list you want 
the item added:
Here, we added the letter z at index 2. Index 2 is the third position in the list (because indi-
ces start at 0). The letter that used to be in the third position, c, got bumped over by one 
place, to the fourth position. Every other item in the list also got bumped one position.

【PG】The difference between append()  and extend()
Sometimes append()  and extend()  look very similar, but they do different things. Let’s go 
back to our original list. First, try using extend()  to add three items:
Now, we’ll try to use append()  to do the same thing:>>> le tters.ex tend(['p', 'q', 'r'])
>>> prin t letters
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'n', 'g', 'p', 'q', 'r']
>>> le tters.inser t(2, 'z')
>>> prin t letters
['a', 'b', 'z', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'n', 'g', 'p', 'q', 'r']
>>> le tters = ['a','b','c','d','e']
>>> le tters.ex tend(['f', 'g', 'h'])
>>> prin t letters
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h']
>>> le tters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
>>> le tters.append([ 'f', 'g', 'h'])
>>> prin t letters
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', ['f', 'g', 'h']]
