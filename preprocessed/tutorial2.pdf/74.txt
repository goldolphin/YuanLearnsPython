【PG】50 Hello World!
It’s like the  raw_input()  func -
tion has print  built in. We’ll use 
that shortcut from now on.

【PG】Inputting numbers
You have seen how to use raw_input()  to get strings. But what if you want to get a number 
instead? After all, the reason we started talking about input was to let the user enter 
temperatures for the temperature-conversion program. 

You already know the answer if you read chapter 4. We can use the int()  or float()  func -
tion to create a number from the string that raw_input()  gives you. It would look like this:
We get the user’s input as a string, using raw_input() . Then we make a number from that, 
using float() . Once we have the temperature as a float, we give it the name fahrenheit . 
But there is a little shortcut. We can do it all in one step, like this:
This does exactly the same thing. It gets the string from the user and then creates a number 
from it. It just does it with a bit less code. 

【PG】Now let’s use this in our temperature-conversion program. Try the following program, and 
see what you get. 
prin t "This program conver ts Fahrenhei t to Celsius"
prin t "Type in a tempera ture in Fahrenhei t: ",   
fahrenhei t = floa t(raw_inpu t())              
celsius = (fahrenhei t - 32) * 5.0 / 9
prin t "Tha t is",                  
prin t celsius,             
prin t "degrees Celsius"

temp_s tring = raw_inpu t() 
fahrenhei t = floa t(temp_s tring)
fahrenhei t = floa t(raw_inpu t())

Use float(raw_input()) 
to get Fahrenheit 
temperature from user
Notice the commas at 
the ends of these lines

【PG】No need to use print  with this baby!
Why pay more for print  when
raw_input()  
has it built right in?! 
And it can be yours for only

That's right!
