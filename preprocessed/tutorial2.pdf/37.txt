【PG】13 CHAPTER  1 Getting Started
Once you’ve saved the code, run it using Run > Run Module , just like you did for the first 
program. Try playing the game and see what happens. Here is a sample of when I ran it:
It took me five guesses to get the secret number, which turned out to be 12.
You’ll learn all about the while , if, else , elif , and input
instructions in the next few chapters. But you can probably 
already get the basic idea of how this program works:
1The secret number is randomly picked by the program. 
2The user inputs guesses. 
3The program checks each guess against the secret 
number: is it higher or lower? 
4The user keeps trying until he guesses the number or
runs out of turns.
When the guess matches the secret number, the player wins.

【PG】What did you learn?
Whew! We covered quite a lot. In this chapter, you
■Installed Python
■Learned how to start IDLE
■Learned about interactive mode
■Gave Python some instructions, and it executed them
■Saw that Python knows how to do arithmetic (including really big numbers!)
■Started the IDLE text editor to type in your first program
