【PG】Python Battle

In this book, we’ve covered how to make your own games. One thing we haven’t talked 
about yet, however, is game artificial intelligence (AI). Almost every game since Pac-Man has 
had some form of artificial intelligence that attacks the player, and this chapter will show 
you how to make one yourself.

【PG】Python Battle

The AIs we’re going to make in this chapter will be part of a game called Python Battle. 
Python Battle is a simple game with simple rules. On each turn, you may move forward, turn 
to face a different direction, or attack. When one bot attacks another, the bot that gets 
attacked loses one “health point. ” The first bot to lose all its health points loses the game. 
Bots can only attack the square directly in front of them.

But Python Battle has one twist: it’s a game played by robots. You have to code a strategy, 
or AI, to control your bot, and then run Python Battle to see how well it does against 
another AI. Of course, the AI code, and Python Battle itself, are written in Python.

Note that Python Battle should be included on your computer if you ran our book’s installer. 
I’ve included three AI programs for you to try out: CircleAI (drives in circles around the 
playing field), RandomAI (moves and turns randomly), and NullAI (doesn’t do anything). 
Let’s try running them against each other to see who wins.
