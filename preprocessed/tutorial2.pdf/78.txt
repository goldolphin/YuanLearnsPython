【PG】How do you get an integer using raw_input() ?

Try it out

【PG】In interactive mode, make two variables, one for your first name and one for your last 
name. Then, using a single print  statement, print your first and last names together.

【PG】Write a program that asks for your first name, then asks for your last name, and then 
prints a message with your first and last names in it.

【PG】Write a program that asks for the dimensions (in feet) of a rectangular room, and then 
calculates and displays the total amount of carpet needed to cover the room.

【PG】Write a program that does the same as in #3, but that also asks for the cost per square 
yard of carpet. Then have the program display these three things:
■The total amount of carpet, in square feet
■The total amount of carpet, in square yards (1 square yard = 9 square feet)
■The total cost of the carpet

【PG】Write a program that helps the user add up her change. The program should ask
■“How many quarters?”
■“How many dimes?”
■“How many nickels?”
■“How many pennies?”
Then it should give the total value of the change.
