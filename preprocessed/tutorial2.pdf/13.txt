【PG】xiii PREFACE
【PG】There are many different programming languages. This book will teach you how to use one 
of those languages—one called Python—to tell the computer what to do.
【PG】We highly recommend using the Hello World installer , which installs the correct version of 
Python you need to use this book. You can find it at www.helloworldbook2.com .

【PG】Why learn programming?
【PG】Even if you don’t become a professional programmer (most people don’t), there are lots of 
reasons to learn programming:
■The most important is because you want to! Programming can be very interesting and
rewarding, as a hobby or a profession.
■If you ’ re interested in computers and want to know more about how they work and
how you can make them do what you want, that’s a good reason to learn about pro -
gramming.
■Maybe you want to make your own games, or maybe you can’t find a program that
does exactly what you want or need it to do, so you want to write your own.
