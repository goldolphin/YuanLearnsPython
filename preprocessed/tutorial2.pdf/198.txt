【PG】174 Hello World!

【PG】Both the Triangle  class and the Square  class have a method called getArea() . So if we had 
an instance of each class, like this,
then we could calculate the area of either one using getArea() :
We used the method name getArea()  for both shapes, but the method did something 
different for each shape. This is an example of polymorphism.

【PG】Inheritance—learning from your parents
In the real (non-programming) world, people can inherit  things from their parents or other 
relatives. You can inherit traits like red hair, or you can inherit stuff like money or property. 
In object-oriented programming, classes can inherit attributes and methods from other 
classes. This allows you to have whole “families” of classes that share common attributes 
and methods. That way, you don’t have to start from scratch every time you want to add a 
member to the family.

【PG】A class that inherits attributes or methods from another class is called a derived class
or subclass . An example will help explain this.
>>> myTriangle = Triangle(4, 5)
>>> mySquare = Square(7)
>>> myTriangle.getArea()
10.0
>>> mySquare.getArea()
49
