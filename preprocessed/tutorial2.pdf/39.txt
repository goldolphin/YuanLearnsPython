【PG】Chapter 2

【PG】Remember This:
Memory and Variables

【PG】What is a program? Hey, wait a minute, I thought we answered that in chapter 1! We said a program was a series of instructions to the computer.

【PG】Well, that’s true. But almost all programs that do anything useful or fun have some other qualities:
■They get input .
■They process  the input.
■They produce output .

【PG】Input, processing, output

【PG】Your first program (listing 1.1) didn’t have any input or processing. That’s one reason why it wasn’t very interesting. The output was the messages the program printed on the screen. 

【PG】Your second program, the number-guessing game (listing 1.2), had all three of the basic elements: 
■The input  was the guesses the player typed in. 
■The processing  was the program checking the guesses and counting the turns.
■The output  was the messages the program printed. 

【PG】Here’s another example of a program that has all three elements: in a video game, the input  is the signals from the joystick or game controller; the processing  is the program figuring out.
