【PG】Hello World!

【PG】Remember, in chapter 19 on sound, we opened our sound files as splat.wav , and so on? We 
didn’t use a path. That’s because I told you to copy the sound files to the same folder where 
you saved the program. If you looked at it in Windows Explorer, it would look something 
like this: 

【PG】Notice that I have Python files (with the .py extension) in the same folder as sound files 
(with the .wav  extension). When a Python program is running, its working directory  is 
whatever folder the .py file is stored in.

【PG】If you stored your program in e:/programs  and ran the program, that program would start 
with e:/programs  as its working directory . If you have a sound file stored in the same folder, 
your program only needs the filename to use that file. It doesn’t need a path to get 
there, because it’s already there. So you can just do this:

【PG】Notice that you don’t need to use the full pathname of the sound file (which would be 
e:/programs/splat.wav ). You just use the filename without the path, because the file is in 
the same folder as the program that’s using it.

【PG】Enough about paths!

【PG】That’s all I’m going to say about paths and file locations. The whole topic of folders and 
directories, paths, working directories, and so on, is one that some people find confusing, 
and it would take a lot of pages to fully explain it. But this book is about programming, not 
about operating systems, file locations, or paths, so if you’re having trouble with this, maybe 
you can ask a parent, a teacher, or someone else who knows about computers to help you.

【PG】All the other examples in this book that use files have them in the same place as the 
program, so you don’t have to worry about the path or about using full pathnames.my_sound = pygame.mixer.Sound( "spla t.wav")
