【PG】35 CHAPTER  3 Basic Math
【PG】What's that letter ‘e’ 
doing in the middle of
the number?

【PG】Increment and decrement
Remember the example from the last chapter: score = score + 1 ? We said that was 
called incrementing . A similar thing is score = score - 1 , which is called decrementing . 
These operations are done so often in programming that they have their own 
operators: += (increment) and -= (decrement).
You use them like this
                                    or 
The first example adds one to the number. (It changes from 7 to 8.) The second one 
subtracts one from the number. (It changes from 7 to 6.)

【PG】Really big and really small
Remember, in chapter 1, when we multiplied those two really big numbers together? We 
got a very big number for the answer. Sometimes, Python shows you big numbers a bit
differently. Try this in interactive mode:
(It doesn’t matter exactly what numbers you type in—any big numbers with decimals 
will do.)
The e is one way of displaying really big or really small numbers on a 
computer. It’s called E-notation . When you’re working with really big 
(or really small) numbers, showing all the digits and decimal places 
can be kind of a pain. These sorts of numbers show up a lot in math 
and science.
