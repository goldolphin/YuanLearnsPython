【PG】360 Hello World!

【PG】What did you learn?

【PG】In this chapter, you learned:
■What randomness and random events are
■A little bit about probability
■How to use the random module to generate random events in a program
■How to simulate flipping a coin or rolling dice
■How to simulate drawing cards from a shuffled deck
■How to play Crazy Eights (if you didn’t already know)

【PG】Test your knowledge

1Describe what a “random event” is. Give two examples.
2Why is rolling one 11-sided die with numbers from 2 to 12 different from rolling a pair 
of 6-sided dice, which produce totals from 2 to 12?
3What are two ways to simulate rolling a die in Python?
4What kind of Python variable did we use for a single card?
5What kind of Python variable did we use for a deck of cards?
6What method did we use to remove a card from the deck when it’s drawn, or from a 
hand when it’s played?

【PG】Try it out

1Try the “10 in a row” experiment using the program from listing 23.3, but try different 
amounts for the “in a row. ” How often do you get five in a row? How about six, seven, 
eight, and so on? Do you see a pattern?
