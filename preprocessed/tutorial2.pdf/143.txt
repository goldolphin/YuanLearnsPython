【PG】119 CHAPTER 12 Collecting Things Together—Lists and Dictionaries

【PG】Try adding another item:
Remember that you have to create the list (empty or not) before you start adding things to 
it. It’s like if you’re making a cake: you can’t just start pouring ingredients together—you 
have to get a bowl out first to pour them into. Otherwise you’ll end up with stuff all over 
the counter! 

【PG】What’s the dot?
Why did we use a dot between friends  and 
append() ? Well, that starts getting into a pretty 
big topic: objects. You’ll learn more about 
objects in chapter 14, but for now, here’s a 
simple explanation.
Many things in Python are objects . To do something with an object, you need the object’s 
name (the variable name), then a dot, and then whatever you want to do to the object. So 
to append  something to the friends  list, you’d write this: >>> friends.append( 'Mary')
>>> prin t friends
['David', 'Mary']

no?
Append means to add something 
to the end. 
When you append something to 
a list, you add it to the end 
of the list.
