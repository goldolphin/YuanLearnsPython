【PG】The sleep_test() function uses a PyQt “warning message” dialog box. A couple of 
parameters tell it which buttons to show and which one of those buttons is the default. 
The notes in listing 24.4 explain this. When the dialog pops up (when you try to wake your 
pet), it looks like this:

【PG】Don’t worry if you don’t understand all this code. You can learn more about PyQt on your 
own if you want. A good place to start is the PyQt website: www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/

【PG】In this chapter, we have only scratched the surface of what can be done with computer sim -
ulations. You have seen the basic ideas of simulating real-world conditions, like gravity and 
time, but computer simulations are widely used in science, engineering, medicine, finance, 
and many other fields. Many of them are very complex and take days or weeks to run even 
on the fastest computers. But even the little virtual pet on your friend’s keychain is a kind of 
simulation, and sometimes the simplest simulations are the most interesting.

【PG】What did you learn?
In this chapter, you learned 
■What computer simulations are and why they’re used
■How to simulate gravity, acceleration, and force
■How to keep track of and simulate time
■How to save timestamps to a file using pickle
■A bit about error handling ( try-except )
■How to use timers to generate periodic events

【PG】Test your knowledge
1List three reasons computer simulations are used.
2List three kinds of computer simulations that you have seen or that you know of.
3What kind of object is used to store a difference between two dates or times?
