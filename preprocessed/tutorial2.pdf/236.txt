【PG】212 Hello World!

【PG】To make things easier, we’re going to make some changes to our code:
■We’re going to have the ball bouncing around forever (or until we close the Pygame 
window). Because we already have a while  loop that runs as long as the window is 
open, we’ll move our ball-display code inside that loop. (That’s the while  loop that is 
in the last part of the program.)
■Instead of always adding 5 to the ball’s position, we’ll make a new variable, speed , to 
determine how fast to move the ball on each iteration. We’re also going to speed the 
ball up a bit by setting this value at 10.

【PG】The new code is in the following listing.
impor t pygame, sys
pygame.ini t()
screen = pygame.display.se t_mode([640,480])
screen.fill([255, 255, 255])
my_ball = pygame.image.load( 'beach_ball.png' )
x = 50
y = 50
x_speed = 10 
running = True
while running:
    for even t in pygame.even t.get():
        if even t.type == pygame.QUIT: 
            running = False
    
    pygame. time.delay(20)
    pygame.draw.rec t(screen, [255,255,255], [x, y, 90, 90], 0)          
    x = x + x_speed                                                 
    if x > screen.ge t_wid th() - 90  or  x < 0:                    
        x_speed = - x_speed                                         
    screen.bli t(my_ball, [x, y])                                        
    pygame.display.flip()                                               
pygame.qui t()

【PG】The key to bouncing the ball off the sides of the window is lines 19 and 20. In line 19 ( if x 
> screen.get_width() - 90 or x < 0: ), we detect whether the ball is at the edge of the 
window, and if it is, we reverse its direction in line 20 ( x_speed = - x_speed ).
Try this and see how it works.

【PG】Bouncing in 2-D
So far, we only have the ball moving back and forth, or one-dimensional motion. Now, let’s 
get it moving up and down at the same time. To do this, we only need a few changes, as 
shown here.
