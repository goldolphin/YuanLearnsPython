【PG】305 CHAPTER  21 Print Formatting and Strings
【PG】Remember that Python counting starts at 0, so the first item in the tuple (the variable math ) 
has index 0, and the second (the variable science ) has index 1. Then you use the .1f just 
like you do with the old method.
【PG】That’s all there is to it. You can store the formatted string to a variable, just like you can with 
the old, % formatting:
【PG】And because you don’t use the % sign to indicate format strings any more, you don’t need 
to do anything special if you want to print a % sign:
【PG】Python programmers will say that using the  format()  syntax is preferred, especially in Python 
3. But you can use whichever syntax you want. The examples in this book all use the % syntax.

【PG】Strings ’n’ things
【PG】When you first learned about strings (back in chapter 2), you saw that you could combine 
two of them with the + sign, like this:
【PG】Now you’re going to find out more things you can do with strings.
【PG】Strings in Python are really objects  (see, everything is an object …), and they have their own 
methods  for doing things like searching, splitting, and combining. These are known as string 
methods . The format()  method you just saw is one of the string methods.

【PG】Splitting strings
【PG】Sometimes you need to split up a long string into a number of smaller ones. Usually you 
want to do this at particular points in the string, like whenever a certain character appears. 
For example, a common way of storing data in a text file is to have items separated from 
each other by a comma. So you might have a list of names that looks like this:distance = 149597870700
【PG】myString = 'The sun is {0:.4e} me ters from the ear th'.forma t(dis tance)
>>> prin t 'I go t {0:.1f}% in ma th'.forma t(math)
I go t 87% in ma th
>>> prin t 'cat' + 'dog'
catdog
>>> name_s tring = 'Sam,Brad,Alex,Cameron,Toby,Gwen,Jenn,Connor'
