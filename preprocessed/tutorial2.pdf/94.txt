【PG】70 Hello World!

【PG】This will check if the variable age has a value between, but not including, 8 and 12. This 
would be true  if age was equal to 9, 10, or 11 (or 8.1 or 11.6, and so on). If we wanted to 
include the ages 8 and 12, we’d do this instead:

【PG】Listing 7.1 shows an example program using comparisons. Start a new file in the IDLE 
editor, type this program in, and save it—call it compare.py . Then Run  it. Try running it 
several times, using different numbers. Try numbers where the first one is bigger, where 
the first one is smaller, and where the two numbers are equal, and see what you get.

num1 = floa t(raw_inpu t("Enter the firs t number: " ))
num2 = floa t(raw_inpu t("Enter the second number: " ))
if num1 < num2:
    prin t num1, "is less than", num2
if num1 > num2:
    prin t num1, "is grea ter than", num2
if num1 == num2:                    
    prin t num1, "is equal to", num2
if num1 != num2:
    prin t num1, "is no t equal to", num2

【PG】What happens if the test is false?
You’ve seen how to make Python do something if the result of a test is true . But what does it 
do if the test is false ? In Python, there are three possibilities:

■Do another test. If the first test comes out false , you can get Python to test something 
else with the keyword elif  (which is short for “else if”), like this:if 8 <= age <= 12:

【PG】Listing 7.1 Using the comparison operators    
if answer >= 10:
    prin t "You go t at leas t 10!"
elif answer >= 5:
    prin t "You go t at leas t 5!"
elif answer >= 3:
    prin t "You go t at leas t 3!"

【PG】Comparison operators  are also called relational 
operators  (because they test the relation  between 
the two sides: equal or not equal, greater than or 
less than). A comparison is also called a conditional 
test or logical test . In programming, logical refers 
to something where the answer is either true or false.
Remember that 
this is a double 
equal sign
