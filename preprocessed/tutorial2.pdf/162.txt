【PG】138 Hello World!

【PG】Let’s add some more names. Unlike the append()  method you use for lists, dictionaries don’t 
have a method for adding new items. You just specify the new key and value:

【PG】Let’s look at the whole dictionary:

【PG】Now, the whole reason we created a dictionary was so we could look things up. In this case, 
we want to look something up by name. You do that like this:
Notice that you use square brackets to specify which key you want within the dictionary. 
But the dictionary as a whole is enclosed in curly brackets.

【PG】A dictionary is somewhat like a list, but there are a couple of main differences. Both types 
are collections ; that is, they are a way of collecting together other types. 
Here are some similarities:
■Both lists and dictionaries can hold any type (even lists and dictionaries), so you can 
have collections of numbers, strings, objects, and even other collections.
■Both lists and dictionaries give you ways to find things in the collection.
And here are some differences:
■Lists are ordered . If you put things in a list in a certain order, they stay in that order. And 
you can sort a list. Dictionaries are unordered . If you add things to a dictionary and 
then display the contents, they may be in a different order than you put them in.
■Items in a list are accessed by their index. Items in a dictionary are accessed by their 
key: 

【PG】As we mentioned before, many things in Python are objects, including lists and dictionaries. 
Just like lists, dictionaries have some methods you can use to work with them, using the dot 
notation you saw before.>>> phoneNumbers[ "Mary"] = "555-6789"
>>> phoneNumbers[ "Bob"] = "444-4321"
>>> phoneNumbers[ "Jenny"] = "867-5309"
>>> prin t phoneNumbers
{'Bob': '444-4321', 'John': '555-1234', 'Mary': '555-6789', 'Jenny': '867-5309'}
>>> prin t phoneNumbers[ "Mary"]
'555-6789'
>>> prin t myLis t[3] 
'eggs'
>>> prin t myDic tionary["John"]
'555-1234'
