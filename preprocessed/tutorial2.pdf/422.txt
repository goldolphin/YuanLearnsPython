【PG】What did you learn?

■How all the parts of the Skier program work

【PG】Try it out
1Try modifying Skier so that it gets harder as the game goes on. Here are some 
suggestions for things to try:
■Make the speed increase as the game goes on.
■Add more trees farther down the hill.
■Add “ice, ” which makes turning more difficult. 

2The SkiFree program that was the inspiration for Skier had an Abominable Snowman 
that randomly appeared and chased the skier. If you’re up for a real challenge, try 
adding something like that to the Skier program. You’ll have to find or create a new 
sprite image and figure out how to modify the code to get the behavior you want.
