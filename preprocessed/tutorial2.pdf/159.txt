【PG】135 CHAPTER  12 Collecting Things Together—Lists and Dictionaries

【PG】Here we looped through the list called classMarks . The loop variable is studentMarks . Each 
time through the loop, we print one item in the list. That one item is the marks for a single 
student, which is itself a list. (We created the student lists above.)

【PG】Notice that this looks very similar to the table on the previous page. So we have come up 
with a data structure to hold all our data in one place.

【PG】Getting a single value from the table
How do we get access to values in this table (our list of lists)? We already know that the first 
student’s marks ( joeMarks ) are in a list that is the first item in classMarks . Let’s check that:
classMarks[0]  is a list of Joe’s marks in the four subjects. Now we want a single value from 
classMarks[0] . How do we do that? We use a second index. 

【PG】If we want the third of his marks (his Reading mark), which has index 2, we’d do this:
This gave us the first item in classMarks  (index 0), which was the list of Joe’s marks, and the 
third item in that list (index 2), which was his Reading mark. When you see a name with two 
sets of square brackets, like classMarks[0][2] , that is usually referring to a list of lists.

【PG】The classMarks  list doesn’t really know about the names Joe, Tom, and Beth, or the subjects 
Math, Science, Reading, and Spelling. We labeled them that way because we knew what 
we intended to store in the list. But to Python, they’re just numbered places in a list. 
This is like the numbered mailboxes at a post office. They don’t have names on them, 
just numbers. The postmaster keeps track of what belongs where, and you know which 
box is yours. >>> prin t classMarks[0]
