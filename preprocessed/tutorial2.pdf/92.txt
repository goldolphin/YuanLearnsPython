【PG】68 Hello World!

【PG】Some statements in Python, like the if statement, need a block of code to tell them what to 
do. In the case of the if statement, the block tells Python what to do if the condition is true.
It doesn’t matter how far you indent the block, as long as the whole block is indented the 
same amount. A convention  in Python is to use four spaces to indent blocks of code. It would 
be a good idea to follow this style in your programs.

【PG】Am I seeing double?
Are there actually two equal signs in that if statement 
(if timsAnswer == correctAnswer )? Yes, there are, 
and here’s why.
People say, “Five plus four is equal to nine, ” and they 
ask, “Is five plus four equal to nine?” One is a statement; 
the other is a question. 
In Python we have the same kinds of things— statements  and questions . A statement  might 
assign a value to a variable. A question  might check whether a variable is equal to a certain 
value. One means you’re setting  something (assigning it or making it equal). The other 
means you’re checking  or testing  something (is it equal, yes or no?). So Python uses two dif -
ferent symbols.

【PG】You already saw the equal sign ( =) used for setting or assigning values to variables. Here are 
a few more examples:
For testing whether two things are equal, Python uses a double equal sign ( ==), like this:correc tAnswer = 5 + 3
tempera ture = 35
name = "Bill"
if myAnswer == correc tAnswer:
if tempera ture == 40:
if name == "Fred":

【PG】A convention  just means lots of people do it that way.
