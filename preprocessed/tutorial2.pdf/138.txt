【PG】114 Hello World!

【PG】Putting this all together, the new calorie-counter version of the hot dog program is shown 
next.

【PG】Did you notice the backslash ( \) characters at the end of the lines in the previous code? If you have
a long expression that won’t fit on a single line, you can use the backslash character to tell Python,
“This line isn’t done. Treat whatever is on the next line as if it’s part of this line.” Here we used two
backslashes to split our long line into three short lines. The backslash is called a line-continuation
character , and several programming languages have them.
You can also put an extra set of parentheses around the whole expression, and then you can split
your expression over multiple lines without using the backslash, like this:
tot_cal = ((dog * dog_cal) + (bun * bun_cal) + 
           (mus tard * mus_cal) + (ke tchup * ke t_cal) + 
           (onion * onion_cal))
