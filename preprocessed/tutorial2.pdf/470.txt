import random
noun_file = open("nouns.txt", 'r')
nouns = noun_file.readline()
noun_list = nouns.split(',')
noun_file.close()

adj_file = open("adjectives.txt", 'r')
adjectives = adj_file.readline()
adj_list = adjectives.split(',')
adj_file.close()

verb_file = open("verbs.txt", 'r')
verbs = verb_file.readline()
verb_list = verbs.split(',')
verb_file.close()

adverb_file = open("adverbs.txt", 'r')
adverbs = adverb_file.readline()
adverb_list = adverbs.split(',')
