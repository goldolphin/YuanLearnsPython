【PG】 58 Hello World!

【PG】 Pick your flavor

【PG】 We’re going to use the example of choosing your favorite flavor of ice cream to 
look at some different ways to get input (the ice cream flavor) from the user 
with EasyGui.

【PG】 Dialog box with multiple buttons

【PG】 Let’s make a dialog box (like a message box) with more than one button. The 
way to do this is with a button box  (buttonbox ). Let’s make a program, rather 
than do it in interactive mode.

【PG】 Start a new file in IDLE. Type in the program in the following listing.
import easygui
flavor = easygui.buttonbox("What is your favorite ice cream flavor?" ,
                  choices = [ 'Vanilla' , 'Chocolate', 'Strawberry' ] ) 
easygui.msgbox ( "You picked " + flavor)

【PG】 The part of the code in square brackets is called a list. We haven’t talked about lists yet, but 
you’ll learn all about them in chapter 12. For now, just type in the code so you can make the 
EasyGui program work. (Or, if you’re really curious, you could skip ahead….)

【PG】 Save the file (I called mine ice_cream1.py ), and 
run it. You should see this:

【PG】 And then, depending on which flavor you click, 
you’ll see something like this:

【PG】 How did this work? The label from whatever button the user clicked was the input . We 
assigned that input a variable name—in this case flavor . This is just like using
raw_input() , except that the user doesn’t type in the input, she just clicks a button. 
That’s what GUIs are all about.
