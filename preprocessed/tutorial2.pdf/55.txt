【PG】Chapter 3 Basic Math

【PG】Operators
The +, -, *, and / symbols are called operators . That’s because they “operate on, ” or work 
with, the numbers you put around them. The = sign is also an operator, and it’s called the 
assignment operator , because you use it to assign a value to a variable.  

【PG】Order of operations
Which one of these is correct?
2 + 3 * 4 = 20
or
2 + 3 * 4 = 14
That depends on what order we do things in. If we do the addition first, we get
2 + 3 = 5, so then 5 * 4 = 20

【PG】An operator  is something that has an effect on, or 
“operates on,” the things around it. The effect can be 
to assign a value to, test, or change one or more of 
those things.
myNumber + yourNumber

【PG】The +, -, *, and / symbols we use for doing 
arithmetic are operators . 
The things being operated on are called operands .

【PG】I learned in school 
that the so-called operands 
in addition are also called 
addends .
