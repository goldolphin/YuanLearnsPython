【PG】327 CHAPTER  22 File Input and Output

【PG】I’m a 
baby dill!I’m a big 
pickle!
And I’m a 
really big 
pickle!
We’re being 
pickled so we can 
be used later!

【PG】The stuff that was in notes.txt  before is gone. It has been replaced by the new stuff from the 
program in listing 22.5. 

【PG】Writing to a file using print
In the last section, we wrote to a file using write() . You can also use print  to write to a file. 
You still have to open the file in write or append mode, but then you can write to the file 
using print , like this:
The two > symbols (which are sometimes called chevrons ) are telling print  to send its 
output to a file instead of to the screen. This is called redirecting  output. 
Sometimes it’s more convenient to use print  than write() , because print  does things like 
automatically converting numbers to strings, and so on. You can decide whether to use 
print  or write()  to put text into a file.

【PG】Saving your stuff in files: pickle
In the first part of this chapter, we talked about reading and 
writing text files. Text files are one way you can store things 
to the hard drive. But what if you want to store 
something like a list or an object? 
Sometimes the items in the list might be 
strings, but not always. And what about 
storing things like objects? You might be 
able to convert all the object’s properties to 
strings and write them to a text file, but then 
you’d have to do the opposite to go from the file 
back to an object. It could get complicated.
Luckily, Python has a way to make storing things 
like lists and objects easier. It’s a Python module 
called pickle . That’s kind of a funny name, but 
think about it: pickling is a way of preserving 
food so you can use it later. In Python, you 
“pickle” your data so you can save it on disk and 
use it later. Makes sense!

prin t >> my_file, "Hello there, neighbor!"
my_file.close()
