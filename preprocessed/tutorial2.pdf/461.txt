【PG】437  APPENDIX  C Answers to Self-Test Questions
Chapter 14: Objects
Test your knowledge
1To define a new object type, you use the class  keyword.
2Attributes are the “things you know” about an object. They are variables contained in 
an object.
3Methods are the actions you can do to an object. They are functions contained in an 
object.
4A class is just a definition or blueprint for an object. An instance is what you get when 
you make an object from the blueprint.
5The name self  is usually used as the instance reference in an object method.
6Polymorphism is the ability to have two or more methods with the same name on dif -
ferent objects. The methods can behave differently depending on which object they 
belong to.
7Inheritance is the ability of objects to acquire attributes and methods from their “par -
ents. ” The “child” class (which is called a subclass or derived class) gets all the attri -
butes and methods of the parent and can also have attributes and methods that are 
not shared with the parent.
