【PG】154 Hello World!

【PG】One way to see what this means is to add a line to the program in listing 13.4 that tries to 
print the value of price  somewhere outside the function. The following listing does this.
def calcula teTax(price, tax_ra te):                      
    total = price + (price * tax_ra te)  
    return total                                         
my_price = floa t(raw_inpu t ("Enter a price: " ))
totalPrice = calcula teTax(my_price, 0.06)   
prin t "price = " , my_price, " To tal price = " , totalPrice
prin t price                           
   
【PG】If you run this, you’ll get an error that looks like this:
The last line of the error message tells the story: when we’re not inside the calcula-
teTax() function, the variable price  is not defined . It only exists while the function is run -
ning. When we tried to print the value of price  from outside the function (when the 
function was not running), we got an error.

【PG】Global variables
In contrast to the local  variable price , the variables my_price  and totalPrice  in listing 13.5 
are defined outside  the function, in the main part of the program. We use the term global  for 
a variable that has a wider scope. In this case, wider  means the main part of the program, 
not what’s inside the function. If we expanded the program in listing 13.5, we could use the 
variables my_price  and totalPrice  in another place in the program, and they would still 
have the values we gave them earlier. They would still be in scope . Because we can use them 
anywhere in the program, we say they’re global variables .

【PG】In listing 13.5, when we were outside the function and tried to print a variable that was 
inside the function, we got an error. The variable didn’t exist; it was out of scope . What do 
you think will happen if we do the opposite: try to print a global variable from inside the 
function? Listing 13.5 Trying to print a local variable
