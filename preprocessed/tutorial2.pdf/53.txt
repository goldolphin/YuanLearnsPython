【PG】29 CHAPTER  3 Basic Math

【PG】The four basic operations
We already saw Python do a little math in chapter 1: addition, using the plus ( +) sign, and 
multiplication, using the asterisk ( *) sign.

【PG】Python uses the hyphen ( -) (which is also called the minus sign) for subtraction, as you 
would expect:

【PG】Because computer keyboards don’t have a division (÷) symbol, all programs use the forward 
slash (/) for division:

【PG】That worked. But sometimes Python does something you might not expect with division:

【PG】Huh ? I thought computers were good at math! Everyone knows that
3 / 2 = 1.5 
What happened?

【PG】Well, although it seems to be acting dopey, Python is really trying to be smart. To explain 
this one, you need to know about integers and decimal numbers. If you don’t know the dif -
ference, check out the word box for a quick explanation. 

【PG】>>> prin t 8 - 5
3
>>> prin t 6/2
3
>>> prin t 3/2
1

【PG】Integers  are the numbers you can easily count, like 1, 2, 3, as 
well as 0 and the negative numbers, like –1, –2, –3.

【PG】Decimal numbers  (also called real numbers ) are the numbers with 
a decimal point and some digits after it, like 1.25, 0.3752, 
and –101.2.

【PG】In computer programming, decimal numbers are also called 
floating-point  numbers, or sometimes floats for short (or float
for just one of them). This is because the decimal point 
“floats” around. You can have the number 0.00123456 or 12345.6 
in a float.
