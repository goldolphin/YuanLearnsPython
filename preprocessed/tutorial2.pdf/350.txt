【PG】326 Hello World!

【PG】new_file = open("my_new_no tes.txt", 'w')
new_file.wri te("Eat supper\n" )
new_file.wri te("Play soccer\n" )
new_file.wri te("Go to bed")
new_file.close()

【PG】How do you know it worked? Check in the folder where you saved the program from 
listing 22.4. You should see a file there called my_new_notes.txt . You can open this file in 
Notepad to see what’s in it. You should see this:
You created a text file with this program and stored some text in it. This text is on the hard 
drive, and it’ll stay there forever—or at least as long as the hard drive keeps working—
unless you delete it. So you have a way to permanently store data from your programs. Now 
your programs can leave a permanent mark on the world (or at least on your hard drive). 
Anything you need to keep when the program stops and the computer is shut off, you can 
put in a file. 

【PG】Let’s see what happens if we use write mode on a file that’s already on the hard drive. 
Remember our file called notes.txt ? If you ran the program in listing 22.3, it looks like this:
Let’s open this file in write mode and write to it, to see what happens. Here’s the code.
the_file = open('notes.txt', 'w')
the_file.wri te("Wake up\n" )
the_file.wri te("Watch car toons")
the_file.close()
Run this code, and then open notes.txt  in Notepad to see what it contains. You should 
see this:Listing 22.4 Using write mode on a new file
Eat supper
Play soccer
Go to bed
Wash the car
Make my bed
Collec t allowance
Spend allowance
Listing 22.5 Using write mode on an existing file
