【PG】In the last chapter, we made our first graphical game, PyPong, using what we have learned about graphics, sprites, collisions, animation, and events. 
【PG】In this chapter, we’ll add another 
piece of the puzzle: sound. Every video game 
and many other programs use sound to 
make them more interesting and 
enjoyable. 
【PG】Sound can be both an input and an 
output. As an input, you’d 
connect a microphone or other 
sound source to the computer, 
and the program would record the sound or do 
something else with it (maybe send it over the 
Internet). But sound is much more common as an output, and that’s what we’ll cover in this 
book. 
【PG】You’ll learn how to play sounds like music or sound effects and add them to your 
programs, like PyPong.
【PG】Sound is another one of those things, like graphics, that can get complicated, because 
different computers have different hardware and software for playing sounds. To make 
things simpler, we’re going to get some help from Pygame again.
