【PG】Chapter 2 Remember This: Memory and Variables

【PG】I typed 
>>> print Teacher 

【PG】So, why didn't it print "Teacher"? 
It printed "Mr. Morton " instead.

【PG】Names
Go back to the Python Shell window. (If you closed IDLE since doing the example
in chapter 1, open it again.) At the prompt, type (Remember, the >>> is the prompt
that Python displays. You just type what is after it and press Enter.) You should see this:

【PG】You just created a thing that is made up of the letters “Mr. Morton”, and you gave it
the name Teacher. The equal sign ( =) tells Python to assign or "make equal to." You
assigned the name Teacher to the series of letters “Mr. Morton.”

【PG】Somewhere in a chunk of your computer’s memory, the letters “Mr. Morton” exist. You
don’t need to know exactly where. You told Python that the name for that series of letters
is Teacher, and that’s how you will refer to it from now on. A name is like a label or tag or
sticky note that you attach to something to identify what it is. 

【PG】When you put quotes around something, Python takes it literally. It prints exactly what
is in the quotes. When you don’t put quotes around the thing, Python has to figure out what
the thing is. It could be a number (like 5), an expression (like 5 + 3), or a name (like Teacher). 
Because you made a name, Teacher, Python prints the thing that belongs to that name, which happens 
to be the series of letters “Mr. Morton.” 

【PG】It’s just like if someone said, “Write down your address. ” You wouldn’t write this: >>> Teacher = "Mr. Morton" 
>>> print Teacher
Mr. Morton
