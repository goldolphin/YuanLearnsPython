【PG】205 CHAPTER  16 Graphics
You can also check what color a pixel is already set to with the Surface.get_at()  method. 
You just pass it the coordinates of the pixel you want to check, like this: pixel_color = 
screen.get_at([320, 240]) . In this example, screen  was the name of the surface.

【PG】Images
Drawing shapes, lines, and individual pixels on the screen is one way to do graphics. But 
sometimes we want to use pictures that we get from somewhere else—maybe from a 
digital photo, something we downloaded from the Web, or something created in an 
image-editing program. In Pygame, the simplest way to use images is with the image
functions.

【PG】Let’s look at an example. We’re going to display an image that is already on your hard drive 
if you installed Python from the book’s installer. The installer created an images  subfolder in 
the \examples  folder, and the file we’re going to use for this example is beach_ball.png . 
So, for example, in Windows, you’d find it at 
c:\Program Files\helloworld\examples\images\beach_ball.png . 
You should copy the beach_ball.png  file to wherever 
you’re saving your Python programs as you work 
through these examples. That way, Python can easily 
find it when the program runs. Once you have the 
beach_ball.png  file in the correct location, type in the 
program in listing 16.10 and try it.
impor t pygame, sys
pygame.ini t()
screen = pygame.display.se t_mode([640,480])
screen.fill([255, 255, 255])
my_ball = pygame.image.load( "beach_ball.png" ) 
screen.bli t(my_ball, [50, 50])              
pygame.display.flip()
running = True
while running:
    for even t in pygame.even t.get():
        if even t.type == pygame.QUIT: 
            running = False
