GUIs—Graphical User 
Interfaces

【PG】Up until now, all our input and output has been simple text in the IDLE window. But mod -
ern computers and programs use lots of graphics. It would be nice if we could have some 
graphics in our programs. In this chapter, we’ll start making some simple GUIs. That means 
our programs will start to look more like the ones you’re used to—with windows, buttons, 
and so on.

【PG】What’s a GUI?

【PG】GUI is an abbreviation for graphical user interface . In a GUI, instead of just typing text and 
getting text back, the user sees graphical things like windows, buttons, text boxes, and so 
on, and she can use the mouse to click things as well as type on the keyboard. The types of 
programs we have done so far are command-line  or text-mode  programs. A GUI is just a 
different way of interacting with a program. Programs that have a GUI still have the three 
basic elements: input, processing, and output. But their input and output are a bit fancier.

【PG】By the way, the acronym GUI is usually pronounced 
“gooey,” instead of saying the letters, like “Gee You Eye.”
 It’s okay to have a GUI on your computer, but you should
 avoid getting anything gooey on your computer. It gets 
stuck in the keys and makes it hard to type!
