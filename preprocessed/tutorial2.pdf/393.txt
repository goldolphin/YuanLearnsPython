【PG】369 CHAPTER  24 Computer Simulations

【PG】Let’s see what we have:
We have created a datetime  object, called when , which contains date and time values.

【PG】When creating a datetime  object, the order of the parameters (the numbers in brackets) is 
year, month, day, hour, minute, second. But if you can’t remember that, you can put them in 
any order you want, as long as you tell Python which one is which, like this:

【PG】There are some other things you can do with datetime  objects. You can get the individual 
pieces like year, day, or minute. You can also get a formatted string of the date and time. 
Try these in interactive mode:

【PG】A datetime  object has both the date and the time. If you only care about the date, there’s 
also a date  class that only has the year, month, and day. If you only care about the time, 
there’s a time  class that only has the hour, minute, and second. Here’s what they look like:

【PG】Just like with the datetime  object, you can pass the parameters in a different order if you 
specify which is which:

【PG】There’s also a way to break up a datetime  object into a date  object and a time  object:

>>> prin t when
2012-10-24 10:45:56
>>> when = da tetime.da tetime(hour=10, year=2012, minu te=45, mon th=10, 
                        second=56, day=24)
>>> prin t when.year    
2012                                                 
>>> prin t when.day                                
24                                  
>>> prin t when.c time()   
Wed Oc t 24 10:45:56 2012

【PG】>>> today = da tetime.da te(2012, 10, 24)
>>> some_ time = da tetime. time(10, 45, 56)
>>> prin t today
2012-10-24
>>> prin t some_ time

【PG】>>> today = da tetime.da te(mon th=10, day=24, year=2012)
>>> some_ time = da tetime. time(second=56, hour=10, minu te=45)
>>> today = when.da te()
>>> some_ time = when. time()

【PG】Gets individual parts of 
datetime object
Prints string 
version of date 
and time
