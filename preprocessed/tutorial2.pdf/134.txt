【PG】Printing the values of variables can help you in lots of 
situations—not just with loops. It’s one of the most 
common debugging methods.

【PG】Using nested loops
So what can we do with all these nested loops? Well, one of the things they’re good for is 
figuring out all the possible permutations  and combinations  of a series of decisions. 

【PG】Permutation  is a mathematical term that means a unique way of 
combining a set of things. Combination  means something very 
similar. The difference is that, with a combination, the order 
doesn’t matter, but with a permutation, the order does matter.

【PG】If I asked you to pick three numbers from 1 to 20, you could 
pick 
  • 5, 8, 14
  • 2, 12, 20
and so on. If we tried to make a list of all the permutations of 
three numbers from 1 to 20, these two would be separate entries:
  • 5, 8, 14 
  • 8, 5, 14
That’s because, with permutations, the order in which they 
appear matters. If we made a list of all the combinations, all 
these would count as a single entry:
  • 5, 8, 14 
  • 8, 5, 14
  • 8, 14, 5
That’s because order doesn’t matter for combinations.
