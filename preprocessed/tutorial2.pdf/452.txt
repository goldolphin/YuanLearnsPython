1The output would be
Because my_number  is less than 20, the test in the if statement is true , so the block 
following the if (in this case, just a single line) is executed.

2The output would be
Because my_number  is greater than 20, the test in the if statement is false , so the 
code in the block following the if is not executed. The code from the else  block is 
executed instead.

3To check if a number is greater than 30, but less than or equal to 40, you would use 
something like this:
You could also do this:

4To check for the letter Q in uppercase or lowercase, you could do something like this:
Notice that the string we printed uses double quotes, but there are single quotes

1Here is one answer:Under 20
20 or over
if number > 30  and  number <= 40:
    prin t 'The number is be tween 30 and 40'
if 30 < number <= 40:
    prin t "The number is be tween 30 and 40"
if answer == 'Q' or answer == 'q':
    prin t "you typed a 'Q' "
# program to calcula te store discoun t
# 10% off for $10 or less, 20% off for more than $10
item_price = floa t(raw_inpu t ('enter the price of the i tem: '))
if item_price <= 10.0:
    discoun t = i tem_price * 0.10
