【PG】92 Hello World!

【PG】This time, the loop didn’t just skip the rest of iteration 3; it stopped altogether. That’s what 
break  does. It works the same way in while  loops. 

【PG】I should tell you that some people think using break  and continue  is a bad idea. Personally, 
I don’t think they’re bad, but I rarely use them. I thought I’d tell you about break  and con-
tinue  just in case you ever need them. 

【PG】What did you learn?
In this chapter, you learned about
■for loops (also called counting loops)
■The range()  function—a shortcut for counting loops
■Different step sizes for range()
■while  loops (also called conditional loops)
■Skipping to the next iteration with continue
■Jumping out of a loop with break

【PG】Test your knowledge
1How many times would the following loop run?
2How many times would the following loop run? And what would the values of i be for 
each loop?
3What list of numbers would range (1, 8)  give you?
4What list of numbers would range (8)  give you?
5What list of numbers would range (2, 9, 2)  give you?
6What list of numbers would range (10, 0, -2)  give you?
7What keyword do you use to stop the current iteration of a loop and jump ahead to 
the next iteration?
8When does a while  loop end?for i in range(1, 6):
    prin t 'Hi, Warren'
for i in range(1, 6, 2):
    prin t 'Hi, Warren'
