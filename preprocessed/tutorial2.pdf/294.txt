【PG】270 Hello World!
pygame.display.flip() 
done = True 
pygame.mixer.music.fadeou t(2000)      

【PG】That’s getting long-ish! (It’s around 100 lines, plus blank lines.) This could be made quite a 
bit shorter, but it might also be harder to read and understand. We’ve been building the 
program a little at a time in these chapters, so you didn’t have to type it all at once. 
If you followed along with the book, you should understand what each part of the program 
does and how the parts go together. And just in case you need it, the full listing is in the 
\examples  folder on your computer (if you installed it) and on the website.

【PG】In the next chapter, we’ll make a different kind of graphical program: one with buttons, 
menus, and so on—a GUI.
