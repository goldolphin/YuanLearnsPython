【PG】294 Hello World!

All of these things will be useful for text-mode (non-GUI) programs, and most of them will 
find their way into GUIs and game programs as well. There’s a lot more Python can do with 
print formatting, but this should be all you will need for 99 percent of your programs.


【PG】New lines

You have already seen the print  statement many times. What happens if you use it more 
than once? Try this short program:

When you run it, the output should look like this:

Why did these two things print on different lines? Why didn’t the output look like this:

Unless you tell it otherwise, Python will start each print  on a new line. After the Hi, Python 
moves down one line and back to the first column to print There . Python inserts a newline
character between the two words. A newline is like pressing Enter  in your text editor. prin t "Hi"
prin t "There"

【PG】file,Thinking like a programmer

Remember back in chapter 5 you learned about 
CR and LF (carriage return and line feed) for 
marking the end of a line of text? And remember 
how I said that some systems use one or the 
other, or both? Newline is the generic name for 
the end-of-line marker on any system. In 
Windows, newline = CR + LF. In Linux, 
newline = LF, and in Mac OS X, newline = CR. 
That way, you don’t have to worry about what 
system you’re on. Just put a newline wherever 
you want to start a new line.print>>>Helloif#print>>>Helloif#
