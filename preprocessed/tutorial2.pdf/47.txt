【PG】23 CHAPTER 2 Remember This: Memory and Variables

【PG】Without the quotes, the 5 and 3 were treated as numbers, so we got the sum. With quotes, 
the ‘5’ and ‘3’ were treated as strings, so we got the two characters “added” together, or ‘53’ . 
You can also add strings of letters together, as you saw in chapter 1:

【PG】Notice that, when you add two strings together like this, there is no space between them. 
They get jammed right together. 

【PG】Long strings
If you want to have a string that spans more than one line, you have to use a special kind of 
string called a triple-quoted string . Here is what it looks like:
This kind of string starts and ends with three quote marks. The quote marks can be double 
or single quotes, so you could also do it this way:
Triple-quoted strings can be very useful when you have several lines of text that you want 
to display together, and you don’t want to use a separate string for each line.>>> prin t "cat" + "dog"
catdog
long_s tring = """Sing a song of sixpence, a pocke t full of rye,
Four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie.
When the pie was opened the birds began to sing.
Wasn' t that a dain ty dish to se t before the king?"""

【PG】Concatenate
It’s not really correct to say “added” when talking about 
strings (like we just did). When you put characters or 
strings together to make a longer string, there is a 
special name for it. Instead of “adding” (which is only 
for numbers), it is called concatenation . This sounds 
like kon-kat-en-ay-shun. 
We say that you concatenate  two strings.
