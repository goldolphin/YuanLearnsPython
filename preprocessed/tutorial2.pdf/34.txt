Syntax errors
IDLE does some checking of your program before it even tries to run it. If IDLE finds an error, 
it’s usually a syntax error . Syntax is the spelling and grammar rules for a programming lan -
guage, so a syntax error  means you’ve typed something that isn’t proper Python code.

Here is an example:
We missed a quotation mark between print  and Bye for now!"
If you tried to run this program, IDLE would pop up a message saying “There’s an error in 
your program: invalid syntax. ” Then you would have to look at your code to see what’s 
wrong. IDLE’s editor will highlight (in red) the place where it found the error. It might not be 
exactly where the problem is, but it should be close.

【PG】Runtime errors
The second kind of error that can happen is one that Python (or IDLE) can’t detect before it 
runs the program. This kind of error only happens when the program runs, so it’s called a 
runtime error . Here’s an example of a runtime error in a program:

If you save this and try to run it, the program actually starts to run. The first two lines are 
printed, but then you get an error message:prin t "Hello, and welcome to Py thon!"
prin t "I hope you will enjoy learning to program."
prin t Bye for now!"   
prin t "Hello, and welcome to Py thon!"
prin t "I hope you will enjoy learning to program."
prin t "Bye for now!" + 5
>>> ============================ RESTART ============================
>>> 
Hello, and welcome to Py thon!
I hope you will enjoy learning to program.
