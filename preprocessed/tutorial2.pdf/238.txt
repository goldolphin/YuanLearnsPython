【PG】214 Hello World!

【PG】To make things simpler, we’ll go back to just moving the ball horizontally. The program is in the next listing.


impor t pygame, sys

pygame.ini t()

screen = pygame.display.se t_mode([640,480])

screen.fill([255, 255, 255])

my_ball = pygame.image.load( 'beach_ball.png' )

x = 50

y = 50

x_speed = 5

running = True

while running:

    for even t in pygame.even t.get():

        if even t.type == pygame.QUIT: 

            running = False

    pygame. time.delay(20)

    pygame.draw.rec t(screen, [255,255,255], [x, y, 90, 90], 0)

    x = x + x_speed

    if x > screen.ge t_wid th():           

        x = 0

    screen.bli t(my_ball, [x, y])

    pygame.display.flip()

pygame.qui t()


【PG】In lines 17 ( if x > screen.get_width(): ) and 18 (x = 0 ), we detected when the ball reached the right edge of the window, and we moved it back, or wrapped it back, to the left side.


【PG】You might have noticed that, when the ball appears on the right, it “pops in” at [0, 50]. It would look more natural if it “slid in” from off screen. Change line 18 ( x = 0 ) to x = -90 and see if you notice the difference.


【PG】What did you learn?

Whew! That was a busy chapter! In it, you learned
■How to use Pygame
■How to create a graphics window and draw some shapes in it
■How to set colors in computer graphics
■How to copy images to a graphics window
■How to animate images, including “erasing” them when you move them to a new place
■How to make a beach ball “bounce” around the window
■How to make a beach ball “wrap” around the window

If the ball is at the far right …

… start over at the left side
