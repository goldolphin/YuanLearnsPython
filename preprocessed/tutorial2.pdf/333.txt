【PG】309 CHAPTER  21 Print Formatting and Strings

【PG】There’s a similar method called endswith()  that does just what you’d expect:

【PG】Now to get back to the problem at hand …. If we wanted to find the start of the 
“Instructions” section of the recipe, we could do something like this:
This code will keep looping until it finds a line that starts with “Instructions. ” Remember 
that lines[i]  means i is the index  for lines . So you’d start with lines[0]  (the first line), 
then lines[1]  (the second line), and so on. When the while  loop finishes, i will be equal to 
the index of the line that starts with “Instructions, ” which is the one we’re looking for.

【PG】Searching anywhere in a string: in and index()
The startswith()  and endswith()  methods work really well for finding things at the start 
or end of a string. But what if you want to find something in the middle of a string? 
Let’s say we had a bunch of strings that had street addresses, like this:
Maybe we want to find all the addresses with “Maple” in them. None of them start or end 
with “Maple, ” but two of them contain the word Maple . How would you find them?
Actually, you already saw how to do this. When we were talking about lists (back in chapter 
12), you saw that you could check whether an item is in a list by doing this:
We used the keyword in to check whether a certain item was in the list. The in keyword 
also works for strings. A string is basically a list of characters, so you can do this:

【PG】>>> name = "Frankens tein"
>>> name.endswi th('n')
True
>>> name.endswi th('stein')
True
>>> name.endswi th('stone')
False

【PG】i = 0
while not lines[i].s tartswith("Ins tructions"):
    i = i + 1

【PG】657 Maple Lane
47 Birch S treet
95 Maple Drive

【PG】if someI tem in my_lis t:
    prin t "Found i t!"

【PG】>>> addr1 = '657 Maple Lane'
>>> if 'Maple' in addr1:
        prin t "Tha t address has 'Maple' in i t."
