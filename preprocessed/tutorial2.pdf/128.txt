【PG】Nested and Variable Loops
We already saw that, within the body of a loop (which is a block of code), we can put other 
things that have their own blocks. If you look at the number-guessing program from 
chapter 1, you’ll see this:
while guess != secre t and tries < 6:                         
        guess = inpu t("Wha t's yer guess? " )                 
        if guess < secre t:                                    
               prin t "Too low, ye scurvy dog!"             
        elif guess > secre t:                             
               prin t "Too high, landlubber!"                
        tries = tries + 1                      
The outer, light gray block is a while  loop block, and the dark gray blocks are if and elif
blocks within that while  loop block. 

【PG】You can also put a loop within another loop. These loops are called nested loops.

【PG】Nested loops
Remember the multiplication table program you wrote for the “Try it out” section in 
chapter 8? Without the user-input part, it might look something like this:
multiplier = 5
for i in range (1, 11):
    prin t i, "x", mul tiplier, "=", i * mul tiplierelif blockif blockwhile loop block
