【PG】259 CHAPTER  19 Sound
We still need a while  loop to keep the Pygame program running. Also, even though we 
won’t be drawing any graphics right now, Pygame programs are not happy unless they have 
a window. And on some systems, mixer  takes a little time to initialize. If you try to start 
playing a sound too quickly, you’ll hear only part of it or none at all. So we will wait a bit for 
mixer  to get ready. The code should look something like the following listing.
impor t pygame, sys
pygame.ini t()                                           
pygame.mixer.ini t()
screen = pygame.display.se t_mode([640,480])                    
pygame. time.delay(1000)                                          
spla t = pygame.mixer.Sound( "spla t.wav")                          
spla t.play()
running = True                 
while running:                                              
    for even t in pygame.even t.get():                    
        if even t.type == pygame.QUIT:                     
            running = False  
pygame.qui t()

【PG】Try this and see how it works.

【PG】Now let’s try playing some music using the mixer.music  module. We only need to change a 
couple of lines in listing 19.1. The new code is shown next.
impor t pygame, sys
pygame.ini t()
pygame.mixer.ini t()
screen = pygame.display.se t_mode([640,480])
pygame. time.delay(1000)
pygame.mixer.music.load( "bg_music.mp3" )  
pygame.mixer.music.play()        
running = True
while running:
    for even t in pygame.even t.get():
        if even t.type == pygame.QUIT: 
            running = False
pygame.qui t()

【PG】Give that a try, and make sure you can hear the music play.
