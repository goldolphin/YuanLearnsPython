【PG】364 Hello World!
【PG】The fuel gauge is just a couple of rectangles drawn with Pygame’s draw.rect()
method. The text is made with pygame.font objects, just like we did for PyPong.
【PG】The code will have sections that do the following:
■Initialize the game—set up the Pygame window, load the images, and set some initial 
values for the variables
■Define the sprite class for the throttle
■Calculate the height, velocity, acceleration, and fuel consumption
■Display the information
■Update the fuel gauge
■Display the rocket flames (which change size depending on the thrust)
■Blit everything to the screen, check for mouse events, update the throttle position, 
and check if the ship has landed—this will be the main Pygame event loop
■Display “Game Over” and final stats

【PG】Listing 24.1 shows the code for Lunar Lander, and you can find it as Listing_24-1.py  in the 
\Examples\LunarLander  folder or on the website ( www.helloworldbook2.com ). The 
graphics (the spaceship and moonscape) are there too. Have a look at the code and the 
notes, and make sure you understand how everything works. Don’t worry about the height, 
velocity, and acceleration formulas. You’ll learn about all that in high school physics, pass 
the exam, and then soon forget it (unless you go to work for NASA). Or maybe this program 
will help you remember!
