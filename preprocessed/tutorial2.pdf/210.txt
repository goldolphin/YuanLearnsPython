【PG】186 Hello World!

【PG】like putting your program to sleep, which is why the function is called sleep() . You tell it 
how many seconds you want it to sleep.

【PG】The program in the following listing demonstrates how the sleep()  function works. Try 
typing, saving, and running it, and see what happens.

impor t time
prin t "How",
time.sleep(2)
prin t "are",
time.sleep(2)
prin t "you",
time.sleep(2)
prin t "today?"

【PG】Notice that, when we called the sleep()  function, we had to put time.  in front of it. That’s 
because, even though we import ed time , we didn’t make it part of the main program’s 
namespace. So every time we want to use the sleep()  function, we have to call
time.sleep() .

【PG】If we tried something like this,
it wouldn’t work, because sleep()  isn’t in our namespace. We’d get an error message 
like this:

NameError: name 'sleep' is no t defined

【PG】But if you import it like this,
that tells Python, “Look for the variable (or function or object) named sleep  in the time
module, and include it in my namespace. ” Now we could use the sleep()  function without 
putting time.  in front of it:

Listing 15.3 Putting your program to sleep
impor t time
sleep(5)

【PG】from time impor t sleep
from time impor t sleep
prin t 'Hello, talk to you again in 5 seconds...'
sleep(5)
prin t 'Hi again'
