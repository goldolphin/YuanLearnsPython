【PG】41 CHAPTER  4 Types of Data

【PG】I tried to get 
Python to add 0.1 and 0.2, 
and the answer came out as 
0.30000000000000004. 
And then I used print  and 
it looked fine.
What’s up with that?

【PG】You’ll learn a lot more about functions later in the book. For now, you just need to know 
that you put the value you want to convert inside the parentheses. The best way to show 
this is with some examples. Follow along in interactive mode in the IDLE shell.

【PG】Changing an int to a float
Let’s start with an integer and create a new floating-point number (decimal number) from 
it, using float() :
Notice that b gets a decimal point and a 0 at the end. That tells us it is a float and not an 
integer. The variable a stays the same, because float()  doesn’t change the original value—
it creates a new one.

【PG】Remember that, in interactive mode, you can just type a variable name (without using 
print ), and Python will display the value of the variable. (You saw that in chapter 2.) That 
only works in interactive mode, not in a program. 

【PG】Changing a float to an int
Now let’s try the reverse—start with a decimal number and create an integer, using int() :
We created a new integer, d, which is 
the whole number  part of c.>>> a = 24
>>> b = floa t(a)
>>> a
24
>>> b
24.0
>>> c = 38.0
>>> d = int(c)
>>> c
38.0
>>> d
38
