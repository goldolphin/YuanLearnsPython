【PG】271 CHAPTER 19 Sound

【PG】Try it out

【PG】1Try adding sounds to the number-guessing game in chapter 1. Even though the game 
is text-mode, you’ll need to add a Pygame window, like we did in the examples in this 
chapter. 

【PG】There are some sounds you can use in the \examples\sounds  folder (and on the website):
■Ahoy.wav
■TooLow.wav
■TooHigh.wav
■WhatsY erGuess.wav
■AvastGotIt.wav
■NoMore.wav  

【PG】Or it might be fun to record your own sounds. You would use something like Sound
Recorder in Windows, or you could download the free program Audacity (which is
available for multiple operating systems) at audacity.sourceforge.net/ .
