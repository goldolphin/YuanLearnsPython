【PG】390 Hello World!
【PG】spaces on the grid. Each space on the grid is 64 x 64 pixels. Because our obstacle sprites 
aren’t that big, there will be some space between them even if they’re in adjacent spaces 
on the grid.

【PG】Creating individual obstacles
First we need to create individual obstacles. We make a class for that, which we call 
ObstacleClass . Just like the skier, this is a Pygame Sprite :

【PG】Creating a map of obstacles
Let’s now create a single screen’s worth of obstacles—enough to fill one 10 x 10 grid, which 
fills the 640 x 640 pixel screen. We randomly sprinkle 10 obstacles (flags and trees) in the 
100 squares of the grid. Each obstacle can be either a flag or a tree. We could end up with 
2 flags and 8 trees, 7 flags and 3 trees, or any combination that adds up to 10. They’re 
randomly chosen. The locations on the grid are also random. 

The only thing we have to watch out for is that we don’t try to put two obstacles in the 
same location. So we keep track of what locations we have used. The variable locations
is a list of the locations we have already used. When placing a new obstacle in a particular 
location, we first check if there is already one in that location:

of the obstacle
Make sure we don’t 
get 2 obstacles in 
the same location
