【PG】136 Hello World!

【PG】A more accurate way to label the classMarks  table would be like this:
Now it’s easier to see that the mark 77 is stored in classMarks[0][2] .
If we were writing a program using classMarks  to store our data, we’d have to keep track of 
which data was stored in which row and column. Just like the postmaster, we’d have the job 
of keeping track of which slot belongs to which piece of data.

【PG】Dictionaries
You just saw that a Python list is a way of collecting items together. Quite often in program -
ming you want to collect things together in a way that lets you associate a value with some 
other value. This is like the way a phone book associates names and phone numbers, or the 
way a dictionary associates words and their definitions.

【PG】You mind?
I’m trying 
to work 
here.
GRRRRRR!
