time what the outcome will be. Two examples are flipping a coin (you don’t know if it 
will come up heads or tails) and rolling a pair of dice (you don’t know what numbers 
will come up on the dice).

noun = random.choice(noun_lis t)
adj = random.choice(adj_lis t)
verb = random.choice(verb_lis t)
adverb = random.choice(adverb_lis t)
prin t"The", adj, noun, verb, adverb + '.'

name = raw_inpu t("Enter your name: " )
age = raw_inpu t("Enter your age: " )
color = raw_inpu t("Enter your favori te color: " )
food = raw_inpu t("Enter your favori te food: " )
my_da ta = open("my_da ta_file. txt", 'w')
my_da ta.wri te(name + "\n")
my_da ta.wri te(age + "\n")
my_da ta.wri te(color + "\n")
my_da ta.wri te(food)
