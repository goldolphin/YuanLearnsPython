【PG】316 Hello World!
【PG】The first level is Music . The next level has New Music  and 
Old Music , and the next level has Kind of old music  and 
Really old music .  

【PG】When you’re trying to find a file or folder in Windows Explorer 
(or some other file browser), the folders are like branches of a tree. 
The root  is the drive itself, like C: or E:. Each main folder is like a main 
branch of the tree. The folders within each main folder are like 
smaller branches, and so on.

【PG】But when you need to access files from within a program, the 
tree idea doesn’t quite work. Your program can’t click folders 
and browse around the tree to find individual files. It needs a more 
direct way to find the file. Fortunately, there’s another way to represent the tree structure. If 
you look in the address bar of Windows Explorer when you click different folders and 
subfolders, you’ll see something that looks like this:

【PG】That’s called the path . The path is a description of where the file is in the folder structure. 
This particular path reads like this:
1Start at the E: drive.
2Go into the folder called Music .
3In the Music  folder, go into a subfolder called Old Music .
4In the Old Music  subfolder, go into a subfolder called Really old music .
5In the Really old music  subfolder, there’s a file called my_song.mp3 .

【PG】You can get to any file on your computer using a path like this. That’s the way programs find and open files. Here’s an example:
You can always get to a file using its full pathname. That’s the name including all the folder 
names right down the tree to the root (the drive, like C:). The name in this example is a full 
pathname. E:\Music\Old Music\Really old music\my_song.mp3

【PG】The folders within other folders are called subfolders . If you’re 
using the term directories , you’d 
call them subdirectories .
