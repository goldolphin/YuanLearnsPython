【PG】306 Hello World!

【PG】Suppose you want to put these names in a list, with each item being one name. You need to 
split this string wherever there’s a comma. The Python method for doing this is called 
split() , and it works like this:
You tell it what character to use as the split marker, and it gives you back a list, which is the 
original string broken into parts.

【PG】If we printed the output from this example, the one big string of names would be split into individual items in a list:
You can have more than one character as the split marker. For instance, you could use 
'Toby,'  as the split marker, and you’d get the following list:>>> names = name_s tring.spli t(',')
>>> prin t names
['Sam','Brad','Alex','Cameron','Toby','Gwen','Jenn','Connor']
>>> for name in names:
        prin t name
    
Sam
Brad
Alex
Cameron
Toby
Gwen
Jenn
Connor
>>> par ts = name_s tring.spli t('Toby,')
>>> prin t parts
['Sam,Brad,Alex,Cameron', 'Gwen,Jenn,Connor']
>>> for part in par ts:
      prin t part
Sam,Brad,Alex,Cameron
Gwen,Jenn,Connor

【PG】Please not me...
don’t split me!
