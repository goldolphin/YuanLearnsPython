【PG】CHAPTER 13 Functions
These are the steps in the previous figure:
1Start here. This is the beginning of the main program.
2When we call the function, we jump to the first line of code in the function.
3Execute each line of the function.
4When the function is finished, we continue where we left off in the main program.

【PG】Calling a function
Calling  a function means running the code that is inside the function. If you define a 
function but never call it, that code will never run.
You call a function by using its name and a set of parentheses. Sometimes there’s some -
thing in the parentheses and sometimes not.
Try running the program in listing 13.1 and see what happens. You should see something 
like this:

【PG】Now, that’s exactly the same output we’d have gotten from a simpler program that looks 
like this:
So why did we go to the trouble of making things more complex and using a function in 
listing 13.1? 

【PG】The main reason to use functions is that, once you have defined them, you can use them 
over and over again just by calling  them. So if we wanted to print the address five times, we 
could do this:
