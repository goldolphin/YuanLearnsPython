【PG】106 Hello World!

【PG】Although you might think it’s pretty boring, a good way to see what’s going on with nested 
loops is to just print some stars to the screen and count them. We’ll do that in the next section.

【PG】Variable loops
Fixed numbers, like the ones you’ve used in the range()  function, are also called constants . If 
you use constants in the range()  function of a for loop, the loop will run the same number 
of times whenever the program is run. In that case, we say the number of loops is 
hard-coded , because it’s defined in your code and never changes. That’s not always what 
you want.

【PG】Sometimes you want the number of loops to be deter -
mined by the user or by another part of the program. 
For that, you need a variable. 
For example, let’s say you were making a space-shooter 
game. You’d have to keep redrawing the screen as 
aliens got wiped out. You’d have some sort of counter 
to keep track of how many aliens were left, and whenever 
the screen was updated, you’d need to loop through the remain -
ing aliens and draw their images on the screen. The number of aliens 
would change every time the player wiped out another one.

【PG】Because you haven’t learned how to draw aliens on the screen yet, here’s a simple example 
program that uses a variable loop: 
The program asked the user how many stars he wanted, and then it used a variable loop to 
print that many. Well, almost! We asked for five stars and only got four! Oops, we forgot that 
the for loop stops one short of the second number in the range . So we need to add 1 to the 
user’s input:for i in range(1, numS tars):                         
     prin t '*',

【PG】>>> ====================== RESTART ======================
>>> 
How many s tars do you wan t? 5
* * * *
numS tars = int(raw_inpu t ("How many s tars do you wan t? "))
for i in range(1, numS tars + 1):  
     prin t '*',                        Adds 1, so if he asks for
5 stars, he gets 5 stars
