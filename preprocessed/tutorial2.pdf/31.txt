【PG】7 CHAPTER  1 Getting Started
Hey, those 
numbers don't fit 
on my calculator!
That’s right. With the computer, you can
do math on really, really big numbers. 
Here’s something else you can do:
        
Or try this:

【PG】Besides math, another thing computers are good at is doing things over and over again. 
Here we told Python to print “Hello” 20 times. 
We’ll do more in interactive mode later, but right now it’s …
Time to program

【PG】The examples we’ve looked at so far are single Python instructions (in interactive mode). 
Although that’s great for checking out some of the things Python can do, those examples 
aren’t really programs. As I mentioned before, a program is a number of instructions 
collected together. So let’s make our first Python program.
First, you need a way to type in the program. If 
you just type it in the interactive window, 
Python won’t “remember” it. You need to use a 
text editor (like Notepad for Windows, or 
TextEdit for Mac OS X, or vi for Linux) that can 
save the program to the hard drive. IDLE comes 
with a text editor that is much better for what 
you need than Notepad. To find it, select 
File > New Window  from IDLE’s menus.

【PG】>>> prin t "cat" + "dog"
catdog
>>>
>>> prin t "Hello " * 20
Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello 
Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello Hello

【PG】When I am talking about menu selections, likeFile > New, the ﬁrst part (Filein this case) is the main menu. The> tells you that the next thing (Newin this case) is an item in the File menu. I will use that notation throughoutthe book.
