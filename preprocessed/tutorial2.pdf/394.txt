【PG】Hello World!

【PG】And you can combine a date  and a time  to make a datetime  object by using the combine()
method of the datetime  class in the datetime  module:

【PG】Now that you have seen what a datetime  object is and some of its properties, we’ll look at 
how you can compare two of them to find the difference between them (how much time 
has passed between one and the other).

【PG】Difference between two times
Quite often in simulations, you need to know how much time has passed. For example, in a 
Virtual Pet program, you might need to know how much time has passed since the pet was 
fed so you can figure out how hungry it is.
The datetime  module has an object class that will help you figure out the difference 
between two dates or times. The class is called timedelta . Remember that delta  means 
“difference. ” So a timedelta  is a difference between two times.
To create a timedelta  and figure out the difference between two times, you just subtract 
them, like this:
Notice that, when we subtracted the two datetime  objects, what we got wasn’t another 
datetime , but rather a timedelta  object. Python does that automatically.

【PG】Small pieces of time
Up to now, we have been looking at time measured in whole seconds. But the time objects 
(date , time , datetime , and timedelta ) are more precise than that. They can measure down 
to the microsecond, which is one millionth of a second.
To see this, try out the now()  method, which gives you the current time of your computer’s 
clock:
import datetime
yesterday = datetime.datetime(2012, 10, 23)
tomorrow = datetime.datetime(2012, 10, 25)
difference = tomorrow - yesterday 
print difference
print type(difference)
print datetime.datetime.now()

【PG】when = da tetime.da tetime.combine( today, some_ time)
