【PG】Chapter 13: Functions
Test your knowledge
1You use the def keyword to create a function.
2You call a function by using its name with parentheses.
3You pass arguments to a function by putting the arguments in the parentheses when you call the function.
4There is no limit to the number of arguments a function can have.
5The function sends information back to the caller using the return  keyword.
6After a function is finished running, any local variables are destroyed.

【PG】Try it out
1The function is just a bunch of print  statements:user_dic tionary = {}
while 1:
    command = raw_inpu t("'a' to add word,  'l' to lookup a word,  'q' to qui t ")
    if command == "a":
        word = raw_inpu t("Type the word: " )
        defini tion = raw_inpu t("Type the defini tion: ")
        user_dic tionary[word] = defini tion
        prin t "Word added!"
    elif command == "l":
        word = raw_inpu t("Type the word: " )
        if word in user_dic tionary.keys():
            prin t user_dic tionary[word]
        else:
            prin t "Tha t word isn' t in the dic tionary ye t."
    elif command == 'q':
        break   
def prin tMyNameBig():
    prin t "  CCCC       A       RRRRR  TTTTTTT  EEEEEE  RRRRR  "
    prin t " C    C     A A      R    R    T     E       R    R "
    prin t "C          A   A     R    R    T     EEEE    R    R "
    prin t "C         AAAAAAA    RRRRR     T     E       RRRRR  "
    prin t " C    C  A       A   R    R    T     E       R    R "
    prin t "  CCCC  A         A  R     R   T     EEEEEE  R     R"
