【PG】401 CHAPTER  26 Python Battle
【PG】■Attack the space directly in front of it
【PG】■Stay still

【PG】In addition, a robot can look at the board any time it wants. The goal of the game is to 
successfully attack an enemy 10 times.
While you were watching CircleAI and RandomAI play against each other, did you notice the 
red and blue squares? When a robot drives over a square, that square turns the same color 
as the bot (red or blue). After 1,000 turns, if neither robot has attacked the other, or if the 
robots are tied in health points, whoever has the most squares in their color wins.

【PG】Creating a Python Battle Robot
Let’s make a robot to try to beat CircleAI and RandomAI. The first step in making a robot is 
to come up with a strategy. For our first Python Battle Robot, we should probably start with 
a simple strategy:
1If I’m facing the enemy, I should attack him.
2If I’m facing a wall, I should turn around.
3Otherwise, I should drive forward.
Although this isn’t the most advanced strategy, it might just beat CircleAI. If it doesn’t, we 
can always go back and tweak it a bit.

【PG】The second step is to start coding the robot. Create a new Python file (I’m going to call mine 
better_than_circleai.py ), and type in this code:
This is the basic code that all robots must start from. The __init__()  function is called 
when the AI is created at the start of the game. The turn()  function is called every round, 
and it decides what the robot does. The class has to be called AI, or Python Battle won’t 
know where to find your AI code.

【PG】The next step in coding the robot is to add the code that makes the bot carry out our strat -
egy. You’ll be using these functions to make the robot move around:
■self.robot.lookInFront()
■self.robot.turnRight()
■self.robot.turnLeft()class AI:
    def __ini t__(self):
        pass
    def turn(self):
        pass
