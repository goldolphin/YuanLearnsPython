【PG】20 Hello World!

【PG】You can create variables for other things besides letters. You can name numeric values. 
Remember our example from before?
Let’s try that one with variables: 
Here, we created two names, First  and Second . The number 5 was assigned to First , and 
the number 3 was assigned to Second . Then we print ed the sum of the two. 

【PG】There’s another way to do this. Try this:
Notice what we did here. In interactive mode, we can display the value of a 
variable just by typing its name, without using print . (This doesn’t work in a 
program.)

【PG】In this example, instead of doing the sum in the print  instruction, we took the thing named 
First  and the thing named Second  and added them together, creating a new thing, called 
Third . Third  is the sum of First  and Second.>>> 5 + 3
8
>>> Firs t = 5
>>> Second = 3
>>> prin t Firs t + Second
8
>>> Third = Firs t + Second
>>> Third
8
