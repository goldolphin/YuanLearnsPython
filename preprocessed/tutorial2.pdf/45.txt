【PG】Chapter 2 Remember This: Memory and Variables

【PG】If we changed 
MyTeacher  
to “Mrs. Tysick ”, 
would YourTeacher  also 
be changed to 
“Mrs. Tysick ”?You can have more than one name for the same thing. Try this in interactive mode:
This is like sticking two tags on the same thing. One 
tag says YourTeacher  and one tag says MyTeacher , but 
they are both stuck on “Mrs. Goodyear” .
That’s a very good question, Carter. The answer is, 
no. What would happen is that a new thing, 
“Mrs. Tysick” , would be created. The tag 
MyTeacher  would get pulled off “Mrs. 
Goodyear” and stuck on “Mrs. Tysick” . You still 
have two different names (two tags), but now 
they are stuck on two different things instead of 
being stuck on the same thing.

【PG】What’s in a name?
You can call a variable anything you want (well, almost). The name can be as long as you 
want, and it can have letters and numbers in it, as well as the underscore character ( _). 
But there are a few rules about variable names. The most important one is that they are 
case-sensitive, which means that uppercase and lowercase matter. So, teacher  and TEACHER
are two different names. So are first  and First .
Another rule is that a variable name has to start with a letter or the underscore character. It 
can’t start with a number. So 4fun  is not allowed.
One more rule is that a variable name can’t have any spaces in it.
If you want to know all the rules for variable names in Python, you can look in appendix A, 
at the back of the book.

【PG】>>> MyTeacher = "Mrs. Goodyear"
>>> YourTeacher = MyTeacher
>>> MyTeacher
"Mrs. Goodyear"
>>> YourTeacher
"Mrs. Goodyear"
