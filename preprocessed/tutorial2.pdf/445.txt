1Python uses the * (asterisk) symbol for multiplication.
2Python would say that 8 / 3 = 2 . Because 8 and 3 are both integers, Python 2 gives the answer rounded down to the nearest integer. (Note that in Python 3, you would get 2.66666666667, because Python 3 doesn’t do “floor division” on integers by default like Python 2 does.)
3To get the remainder, use the Modulus operator: 8 % 3 . 
4To get the decimal answer for 8 / 3 , change one of them into a decimal number: 8.0 / 3 or 8 / 3.0 . (Note that in Python 3, you get the decimal answer automatically.)
5What’s another way of calculating 6 * 6 * 6 * 6  in Python? 6 ** 4 .
617,000,000 in E-notation would be written as 1.7e7 .
74.56e-5  is the same as 0.0000456 .

【PG】>>> tempera ture = 40
>>> prin t tempera ture
40
>>> tempera ture = tempera ture + 15
>>> prin t tempera ture
40
>>> firs tName = "Fred"
>>> prin t firs tName
Fred
>>> DaysPerWeek = 7
>>> HoursPerDay = 24
>>> Minu tesPerHour = 60
>>> prin t DaysPerWeek * HoursPerDay * Minu tesPerHour
10080
>>> HoursPerDay = 26
>>> prin t DaysPerWeek * HoursPerDay * Minu tesPerHour
10920
