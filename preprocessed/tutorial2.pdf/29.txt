【PG】 CHAPTER  1 Getting Started
Hey, I didn't see 
the orange color on
pront  like I did 
on print.If it doesn’t work
If you made a mistake, you might see something like this:
That error message means you typed something that Python
didn’t understand. In this example, print  is misspelled pront , and
Python doesn’t know what to do with that. If that happens to you,
try again and make sure you type it exactly like in the example.
        Тhat’s right. That’s because 
        print  is a Python keyword, 
        and pront  is  not.

【PG】 Interacting with Python
What you just did was use Python in interactive mode. You typed a command (an instruc -
tion), and Python executed  it immediately.
Let’s try something else in interactive mode. Type this at the prompt:
You should get this:>>> pron t "Hello World!"
SyntaxError: invalid syn tax
>>>
>>> prin t 5 + 3
8
>>>A keyword is a special word that 
is part of the Python language 
(also known as a reserved word).
Executing a command, instruction, or program is just a 
fancy way of saying “running” it, or “making it happen.”
