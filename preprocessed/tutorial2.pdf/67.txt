【PG】43 CHAPTER  4 Types of Data

【PG】Let’s try another one:
Even though 54.99 is very close to 55, we still get 54 for the integer. The int()  function 
always rounds down. It doesn’t give the nearest  integer, it gives the next lowest  integer. The 
int()  function basically chops off the decimal part. 
If you want to get the nearest integer, there is a way. You’ll learn about that in chapter 21.

【PG】Changing a string to a float
You can also create a number from a string, like this:
Notice that, when we display a, the result has quotes around it. That’s Python’s way of 
telling us that a is a string. When we display b, we get the floating-point value.
>>> e = 54.99
>>> f = int(e)
>>> prin t e
54.99
>>> prin t f
54
>>> a = '76.3'
>>> b = floa t(a)
>>> a
'76.3'
>>> b
76.3
