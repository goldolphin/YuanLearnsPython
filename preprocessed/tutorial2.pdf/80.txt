【PG】56 Hello World!
【PG】Our first GUI
You have already been using a GUI—in fact, several of them. A web browser is a GUI. IDLE is 
a GUI. Now you’re going to make your own GUI. To do this, you’re going to get some help 
from something called EasyGui.

EasyGui is a Python module that makes it very easy to make simple GUIs. We haven’t really 
talked about modules yet (we will in chapter 15), but a module is a way of adding 
something to Python that isn’t already built in.

If you installed Python using the book’s installer, you already have EasyGui installed. If not, 
you can download it from easygui.sourceforge.net/ .

【PG】Installing EasyGui
You can download easygui.py  or a zip file that contains easygui.py . To install it, you just 
have to put the file easygui.py  in a place where Python can find it. Where is that?

The Python path
Python has a list of places on the hard drive where it looks for modules it can use. This can 
be a bit complicated, because it’s different for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux. But if you put 
easygui.py  in the same place where Python itself is installed, Python will find it. So, on your 
hard drive, look for a folder called Python27 , and put easygui.py  in that folder.

【PG】Let’s get GUI-ing
Start IDLE, and type the following in interactive mode:
This tells Python that you’re going to use the EasyGui module. If you don’t get an error 
message, then Python found the EasyGui module. If you do get an error message, or 
EasyGui doesn’t seem to be working, go to the book’s web site ( www.helloworldbook2.com ) 
and you’ll find some additional help.

Now, let’s make a simple message box with an OK button:>>> impor t easygui
>>> easygui.msgbox( "Hello There!" )
