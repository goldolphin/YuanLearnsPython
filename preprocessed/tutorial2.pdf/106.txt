【PG】82 Hello World!

【PG】Now we’re starting to see the power of loops. Without loops, we’d have had to write a program like this one to get the same result:
To make a longer multiplication table (say, up to 10 or 20), this program would be a lot longer, but our loop program would be almost the same (just with more numbers in the list). Loops make this much easier!

【PG】A shortcut— range()
In the previous example, we only looped 5 times:
But what if we wanted the loop to run 100 times, or 1,000 times? That would be a lot of typing!
Luckily, there’s a shortcut. The range() function lets you enter just the starting and ending values, and it creates all the values in between for you. range() creates a list containing a range of numbers.

【PG】The next listing uses the range() function in the multiplication table example.
for looper in range (1, 5):
    print looper, "times 8 =" , looper * 8
print "1 times 8 =" , 1 * 8
print "2 times 8 =" , 2 * 8
print "3 times 8 =" , 3 * 8
print "4 times 8 =" , 4 * 8
print "5 times 8 =" , 5 * 8
for looper in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
