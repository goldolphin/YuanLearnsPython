【PG】CHAPTER 15 Modules
If you want the convenience of importing names into the local namespace (so you don’t 
have to specify the module name every time), but you don’t know which names in the 
module you’ll need, you can use the star ( *) to import all names into your namespace:
The * means all, so this imports all the available names from the module. You have to be 
careful with this one. If you create a name in your program that is the same as one in the 
time  module, there will be a conflict. Importing with * isn’t the best way to do it. It’s better 
to only import the parts that you need.

【PG】Remember the countdown program we made in chapter 8 (listing 8.6)? Now you know what 
the line time.sleep(1)  in that program was doing.

【PG】Random numbers
The random  module is used for generating random numbers. This is very useful in games 
and simulations.
Let’s try using the random  module in interactive mode:
Each time you use random.randint() , you get a new, random integer. Because we passed the 
arguments 0 and 100 to it, the integer will be between 0 and 100. We used random.randint()
in the number-guessing program in chapter 1 to create the secret number.
If you want a random decimal number, use random.random() . You don’t have to put 
anything between the brackets, because random.random()  always gives you a number 
between 0 and 1:
If you want a random number between, say, 0 and 10, you can just multiply the result by 10:
from time import *
>>> import random
>>> print random.randint(0, 100)
4
>>> print random.randint(0, 100)
72
>>> print random.random()
0.270985467261
>>> print random.random()
0.569236541309
>>> print random.random() * 10
3.61204895736
>>> print random.random() * 10
8.10985427783
