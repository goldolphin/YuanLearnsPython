【PG】Try it out
1You made a text-based number-guessing program in chapter 1, and you made a 
simple GUI version of the same game in chapter 6. Try making a GUI version of the 
number-guessing game using PyQt.
2Did you find the problem with the spin box when it wouldn’t display any values below 
0? (Carter found this bug in listing 20.2.) Fix the spin box properties to solve this 
problem. Make sure you fix both ends of the scale so the spinner can display very high 
temperatures as well as very low ones. (Maybe your user is going to convert the 
temperatures on Mercury and Venus, as well as on Pluto!)
