【PG】To get a string as input using EasyGui, use an enterbox .

【PG】To get an integer as input, you can use an enterbox  (which gets a string from the user) 
and then convert it to an int. Or you can use an integerbox .

【PG】To get a float from the user, you can use an enterbox  (which gives you a string)  and 
then use the float()  function to convert the string to a float.

【PG】A default value is like an “automatic answer. ” Here’s one way you might use a default: if 
you were writing a program where all the students in your class had to enter their 
name and address, you might have the name of the city where you live as the default 
city in the address. That way, the students wouldn’t have to type it in unless they lived 
in a different city.

【PG】Here is a temperature-conversion program using EasyGui:
# tempgui1.py
# EasyGui version of tempera ture-conversion program
# conver ts Fahrenhei t to Celsius
impor t easygui
easygui.msgbox( 'This program conver ts Fahrenhei t to Celsius' )
tempera ture  = easygui.en terbox('Type in a tempera ture in Fahrenhei t:')
Fahr = floa t(tempera ture)
Cel = (Fahr - 32) * 5.0 / 9
easygui.msgbox( 'Tha t is ' + str(Cel) + ' degrees Celsius.' )

【PG】Here is a program that asks for your name and the parts of your address and then 
displays the whole address. For this one, it helps to know how to force a newline . A 
newline makes the following text start on a new line. To do this, you use \n. This is 
explained in chapter 21, but here is a preview:
# address.py
# En ter par ts of your address and display the whole thing
impor t easygui
name = easygui.en terbox("Wha t is your name?" )
addr = easygui.en terbox("Wha t is your s treet address?" )
city = easygui.en terbox("Wha t is your ci ty?")
state = easygui.en terbox("Wha t is your s tate or province?" )
code = easygui.en terbox("Wha t is your pos tal code or zip code?" )
whole_addr  = name + "\n" + addr + "\n" + ci ty + ", " + state + "\n" + code
easygui.msgbox(whole_addr, "Here is your address:" )
