【PG】CHAPTER  1 Getting Started
In the Start  menu, under Python 2.7 , you’ll see IDLE (Python GUI) . Click this option, and the 
IDLE window will open. It should look something like the window below.

IDLE is a Python shell . A shell is basically a way of 
interacting with a program by typing text, and 
this shell lets you interact with Python. (That’s 
why you see Python Shell  in the title bar of the 
window.) IDLE also happens to be a GUI, which 
is why it says Python GUI  in the Start  menu. 
IDLE has some other things besides the shell, 
but we’ll get to all that in a minute.  

【PG】The  >>> in the previous figure is the Python prompt . A prompt is what a program displays 
when it’s waiting for you to type something. The >>> prompt tells you that Python is ready 
for you to start typing Python instructions.

Instructions, please
Let’s give Python our first instruction. With the cursor at the end of the >>> prompt, type
and press the Enter key. (On some keyboards, this is called the Return key.) You need to 
press the Enter key after every line you type. 
After you press the Enter key, you should get this response:

prin t "Hello World!"

Hello World!
>>>

【PG】GUI stands for graphical user 
interface . This means something 
with windows, menus, buttons, 
scrollbars, etc. Programs 
that don’t have a GUI are 
called text-mode  programs, 
console programs, or 
command-line  programs.
