【PG】Chapter 11 Nested and Variable Loops
【PG】Another way to do the same thing is to start the loop counting at 0, instead of 1. (We 
mentioned that back in chapter 8.) This is very common in programming, and you’ll see 
why in the next chapter. Here’s how that would look:
【PG】Variable nested loops
【PG】Now let’s try a variable nested loop . That’s just a nested loop where one or more of the loops 
uses a variable in the range()  function. Here’s an example.
【PG】numLines = int(raw_inpu t ('How many lines of s tars do you wan t? '))
numS tars = int(raw_inpu t ('How many s tars per line? ' ))
for line in range(0, numLines):
    for star in range(0, numS tars): 
        prin t '*',
    prin t
【PG】Try running this program to see if it makes sense. You should see something like this:
【PG】The first two lines ask the user how many lines she wants and how many stars per line. It 
remembers the answers using the variables numLines  and numStars . Then we have the two 
loops:
■The inner loop ( for star in range (0, numStars): ) prints each star and runs once 
for each star on a line. 
■The outer loop ( for line in range (0, numLines): ) runs once for each line of stars. 
【PG】The second print  command is needed to start a new line of stars. If we didn’t have that, all 
the stars would print on one line because of the comma in the first print  statement.
【PG】numS tars = int(raw_inpu t ("How many s tars do you wan t? "))
for i in range(0, numS tars):                               
     prin t '*',
