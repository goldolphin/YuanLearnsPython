【PG】172 Hello World!
Run the program, and see what you get. It should look like this:
The first part of the program creates the class. The second part tests the 
methods to cook our virtual hot dog and add some condiments. But 
judging by that last couple of lines, I think we cooked it too much. 
What a waste of ketchup and mustard!

【PG】Hiding the data
You might have realized that there are two ways you can view or change the data (attri -
butes) inside an object. You can either access an attribute directly, like this
or you can use a method that modifies the attribute, like this:
If the hot dog started out raw ( cooked_level = 0 ), these would both do the same thing. 
They’d set the cooked_level  to 5. So why did we bother making a method to do this? Why 
not just do it directly?

【PG】I can think of at least two reasons:
■If we were accessing the attributes directly, then cooking the hot dog would require at 
least two parts: changing the cooked_level  and changing the cooked_string . With a 
method, we just make one method call, and it does everything we need.
■If we were accessing the attributes directly, we could do something like this:>>> ================================ RESTART ================================
>>> 
Raw ho t dog.
Cooking ho t dog for 4 minu tes...
Medium ho t dog.
Cooking ho t dog for 3 more minu tes...
Well-done ho t dog.
What happens if I cook i t for 10 more minu tes?

【PG】Now, I'm going to add some s tuff on my ho t dog
Charcoal ho t dog wi th ke tchup, mus tard.
myDog.cooked_level = 5
myDog.cook(5)
cooked_level = cooked_level - 2
