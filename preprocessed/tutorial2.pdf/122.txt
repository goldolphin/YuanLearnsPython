【PG】98 Hello World!
Commenting out
You can also use comments to temporarily exclude parts of the program from running. 
Anything that is a comment will be ignored:
Because print "Hello"  was commented out, that line was not executed, so the word 
“Hello” didn’t print. 
This is useful when you’re debugging a program and only want certain parts to run and 
other parts to be ignored. Just put a # in front of any line you want the computer to ignore, 
or put triple quotes around a section of code you want the computer to ignore.

【PG】Most code editors, including IDLE, have a feature that lets you comment (and uncomment) 
whole blocks of code quickly. In IDLE’s editor, look in the Format  menu.

【PG】What did you learn?
In this chapter, you learned that
■Comments are just for you (and other humans), not for the computer.
■Comments can also be used to block out parts of the code, to prevent them from 
running.
■You can use triple-quoted strings as a kind of comment that spans multiple lines.

【PG】Test your knowledge
Because comments are pretty simple, we’ll take a break and not have any test questions for 
this chapter.

【PG】Try it out
Go back to the temperature-conversion program (from the “Try it out” section in chapter 3), 
and add some comments. Rerun the program to see that it still runs the same. #prin t "Hello"
prin t "World"
