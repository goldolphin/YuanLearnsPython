【PG】Objects in the real world

What’s an object? If we were not talking about programming, and I asked you that question, 
we might have a conversation like this:

That’s a good start at defining what an object is in Python, too. Take a ball, for example. You 
can do things to a ball, like pick it up, throw it, kick it, or inflate it (for some balls). We call 
these actions. You can also describe a ball by telling me its color, size, and weight. These are 
attributes  of a ball. 

Real objects in the real world have
■Things that you can do to  them (actions)
■Things that describe  them (attributes or properties)

【PG】In programming, we have the same kind of thing. 

【PG】Objects in Python 

In Python, the characteristics, or “things you know” about an object, are also called 
attributes , so that should be easy to remember. In Python, the actions, or “things you 
can do” to an object, are called methods . 

If you were to make a Python version or model  of a ball, the ball would be an object and it 
would have attributes  and methods . You can do things 
to objects, like 
pick them up.

【PG】What is an object?
An object 
is a thing. What else can 
you tell me about 
objects or things? How do you 
describe 
an object?
I tell you what 
it looks like... 
you know, 
what color it is...
how big it is... 
what it can do... 
that kind of stuff.

You can describe an object by describing its characteristics or 
attributes . One of the attributes of a ball is its shape. Most 
balls have a round shape. Other examples of attributes are color, 
size, weight, and cost. Another word for attributes is properties .
