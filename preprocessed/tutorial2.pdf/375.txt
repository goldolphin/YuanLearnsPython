【PG】Chapter 23 Take a Chance—Randomness
The face-up card
When the hand is first dealt, one card from the deck is turned up to start the discard pile. 
When any player plays a card, it goes on the discard pile, face up. The card that’s showing 
on the discard pile at any time is called the up card . We could keep track of this by making a 
list for the discard pile, the same way we made a list for the “hand” in our test code in 
listing 23.5. But we don’t really care about all the cards in the discard pile. We only care 
about the last card added to it. So we can just use a single instance of a Card  object to 
keep track of it.
When the player or computer plays a card, we’ll do something like this:

The active suit
Usually, the active suit (the one the player or computer is trying to match) is the same as 
the suit of the up card. But there’s an exception. When an 8 has been played, the player calls 
the suit. So if he plays the 8 of Diamonds, he might call Clubs as the suit. That means that 
the next play must match Clubs, even though a Diamond (the 8 of Diamonds) is showing.hand.remove(chosen_card)
up_card = chosen_card

【PG】Thinking like a programmer
The approach described above is called 
top-down programming. 
That's where you start with the outline 
of what is needed and then fill in the 
details.
Another way to do it is bottom-up. In 
that method, you would first create all 
the individual parts, like the player's 
turn, the computer's turn, and so on, and 
then put them together like building 
blocks.
Both approaches have advantages and 
disadvantages. Deciding how to choose one 
over the other is not a topic for this 
book. But I thought you should know that 
there are different ways to tackle 
building a program.
