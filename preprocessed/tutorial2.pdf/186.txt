【PG】162 Hello World!

【PG】Hm... How would I describe 
this house? Upper class, 
middle class, or lower class?

【PG】Object = attributes + methods
So objects are a way of collecting together attributes  and methods  (things you know, and 
things you can do) for a thing. Attributes are information, and methods are actions.

【PG】What’s the dot?
In our previous ball examples, you probably noticed the dot between the name of the 
object and the name of the attribute or method. That’s just the Python notation for using 
the attributes and methods of an object: object.attribute or object.method() . Simple as 
that. It’s called dot notation , and it’s used in many programming languages.

【PG】Now you have the big picture about objects. Let’s start making some!
Creating objects
There are two steps to creating an object in Python. 
The first step is to define what the object will look like and act like—its attributes and 
methods. But creating this description doesn’t actually create an object. It’s kind of like the 
blueprints for a house. The blue -
prints tell you exactly what the house 
will look like, but a blueprint isn’t a 
house. You can’t live in a blueprint. 
You can just use it to build an actual 
house. In fact, you can use the blue -
print to make many houses. 

【PG】In Python the description or blueprint of 
an object is called a class .
The second step is to use the class to make 
an actual object. The object is called an 
instance  of that class. 
Let’s look at an example of making a class
and an instance . The following listing 
shows a class definition for a simple 
Ball  class.
