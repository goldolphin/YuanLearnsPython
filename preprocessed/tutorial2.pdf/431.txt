【PG】407 CHAPTER  26 Python Battle

【PG】What?! 
CircleAI
won again! 

【PG】I guess we’ll need to revise our strategy a little in order to 
beat CircleAI. CircleAI is so hard to beat because it’s hard to hit. If you 
try to attack it from the side or back, it will run away before your 
robot can hit it more than once. Also, because it hugs the wall, 
there’s only one side you can attack it from. If you try to attack it 
from the front, it will most likely get the first hit and thus win the 
game. Even if it’s not the most advanced strategy, CircleAI is really 
tough to beat. 

【PG】It’s probably possible to devise an AI that can beat CircleAI consistently, but that’s if you 
know CircleAI is the AI you’re going up against. If you don’t know what the other player is 
using as a strategy for their AI, it’s even trickier!
