【PG】Chapter 8 Loop the Loop

【PG】Here we go again...
Counting loops

【PG】The first kind of loop is called a counting loop. You’ll also hear it called a for loop, because many languages, including Python, use the for keyword to create this kind of loop in a program. 

【PG】Let’s try a program that uses a counting loop. Start a new text editor window in IDLE, using the File > New command (like we did for our first program). Then type in the following program.

for looper in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
    prin t "hello"

【PG】Save it as Loop1.py, and run it. (You can use the Run > Run Module menu option or the shortcut of pressing the F5 key.)

【PG】You should see something like this:

Hey, is there an echo in here? The program printed “hello” five times, even though there was only one print  statement. 

【PG】How? The first line (for looper in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:) translated into plain English means this:

1 The variable looper starts with the value 1 (so looper = 1).
2 The loop does whatever is in the next block of instructions one time for each value in the list. (The list is those numbers in square brackets.)
3 Each time through the loop, looper is assigned the next value in the list.
