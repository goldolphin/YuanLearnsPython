【PG】59 CHAPTER  6 GUIs—Graphical User Interfaces
What's going 
on?When I tried this, 
my choice box was a 
lot bigger. It almost filled 
the whole screen!  
And I can’t make it 
much smaller by resizing the 
window, because it 
won’t let me.Choice box

【PG】Let’s try another way for the user to select a flavor. EasyGui has something called a choice 
box (choicebox ), which presents a list of choices. The user picks one and then clicks the OK
button. 

【PG】To try this, we only need to make one small change to our program from listing 6.1: change 
buttonbox  to choicebox . The new version is shown next.
impor t easygui
flavor = easygui.choicebox( "Wha t is your favori te ice cream flavor?" ,
                  choices = [ 'Vanilla' , 'Chocola te', 'Strawberry' ] )
easygui.msgbox ( "You picked " + flavor)

【PG】Save the program in listing 6.2, and run it. You should see something like this:
After you click a flavor and then click OK, you’ll see the same kind of message box as before. 
Notice that, in addition to clicking choices with the mouse, you can select a flavor with the 
up and down arrow keys on the keyboard.

【PG】If you click Cancel , the program will end, and you’ll also 
see an error. That’s because the last line of 
the program is expecting some text 
(like Vanilla ), but if you click Cancel , it 
doesn’t get any. Listing 6.2 Getting input using a choice box
