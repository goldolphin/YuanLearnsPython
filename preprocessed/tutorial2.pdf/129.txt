【PG】105 CHAPTER  11 Nested and Variable Loops

【PG】What if you wanted to print three multiplication tables at once? That’s the kind of thing a nested loop  is perfect for. A nested loop is one loop inside another loop. For each  iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop goes through all of its iterations.

【PG】To print three multiplication tables, you’d just enclose the original loop (which prints a single multiplication table) in an outer loop (which runs three times). This makes the program print three tables instead of one. The following listing shows what the code looks like.
for multiplier in range (5, 8):
    for i in range (1, 11): 
        prin t i, "x", mul tiplier, "=", i * mul tiplier  
    prin t

【PG】Notice that we had to indent the inner loop and the print statement an extra four spaces from the beginning of the outer for loop. This program will print the 5 times, 6 times, and 7 times tables, up to 10 for each table: Listing 11.1 Printing three multiplication tables at once

6 x 7 = 42
7 x 7 = 49
8 x 7 = 56
9 x 7 = 63
10 x 7 = 70

【PG】This inner loop prints a single table

【PG】This outer loop runs 3 iterations, with values 5, 6, 7
