【PG】436 Hello World!

【PG】The program that calls it could look like this:

【PG】Here’s my example for printing addresses with seven arguments:

【PG】No answer, just try it.

【PG】The function to add up change should look like this:

The program that calls it would look like this:for i in range(5):
    prin tMyNameBig()

# define a func tion wi th seven argumen ts 
def prin tAddr(name, num, s treet, ci ty, prov, pcode, coun try): 
    prin t name 
    prin t num, 
    prin t street
    prin t city, 
    if prov !="": 
        prin t ", "+prov 
    else: 
        prin t "" 
    prin t pcode
    prin t coun try 
    prin t 

#call the func tion and pass seven argumen ts to it 
prin tAddr("Sam", "45", "Main S t.", "Ottawa", "ON", "K2M 2E9" , "Canada" )
prin tAddr("Jian", "64", "2nd Ave." , "Hong Kong" , "", "235643" , "China")

【PG】def addUpChange(quar ters, dimes, nickels, pennies):
    total  = 0.25 * quar ters + 0.10 * dimes + 0.05 * nickels + 0.01 * pennies
    return total

quar ters = int(raw_inpu t("quar ters: "))
dimes = int(raw_inpu t("dimes: " ))
nickels = int(raw_inpu t("nickels: " ))
pennies = int(raw_inpu t("pennies: " ))
total  = addUpChange(quar ters, dimes, nickels, pennies)
prin t "You have a total of: " , total
