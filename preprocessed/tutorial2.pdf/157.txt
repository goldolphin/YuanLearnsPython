【PG】Chapter 12 Collecting Things Together—Lists and Dictionaries

【PG】Mutable and immutable
If you remember back to chapter 2, we said that you couldn’t actually change a number or 
string, you could only change what number or string a name  was assigned to (in other 
words, move the tag). But lists are one of the types in Python that can be  changed. As you 
just saw, lists can have items appended or deleted, and the items can be sorted or reversed.
These two different kinds of variables are called mutable  and immutable . Mutable  just means 
“able to be changed” or “changeable. ” Immutable  means “not able to be changed” or 
“unchangeable. ” In Python, numbers and strings are immutable (cannot be changed), and 
lists are mutable (can be changed).

【PG】Tuple—an immutable list
There are times when you don’t want a list to be changeable. So, is there an immutable kind 
of list in Python? The answer is yes. There is a type called a tuple , which is exactly that, an 
immutable (unchangeable) list. You make one like this:
You use round brackets, instead of the square ones that lists use. 
Because tuples are immutable (unchangeable), you can’t do things like sort them or append 
or delete items. Once you create a tuple with a set of items, it stays that way.

【PG】Lists of lists: tables of data
When thinking about how data is stored in a program, it’s useful to visualize it.
A variable has a single value. 
A list is like a row of values strung together.
Sometimes you need a table  with rows and columns.
