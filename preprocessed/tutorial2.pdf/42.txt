【PG】18 Hello World!
(Well, maybe Carter would, because he likes to kid around …)

【PG】You would write 
something like this:
If you wrote “Your Address” , you would be taking the statement literally. Python doesn’t 
take things literally unless you use quote marks. Here’s another example:
With quote marks, Python printed exactly what you told it: 53 + 28. 
Without quote marks, Python treated the 53 + 28 as an arithmetic expression , and it evaluated
that expression. In this case, it was an expression for adding two numbers together, so 
Python gave you the sum. 

【PG】Python takes care of figuring out how much memory it needs to store the letters and what 
part of the memory it will use. To retrieve your information (get it back), you just need to 
use the same name again. You used the name  along with the print  keyword, which displays 
things (like numbers or text) on the screen.

【PG】>>> prin t "53 + 28"
53 + 28
>>> prin t 53 + 28
81

【PG】An arithmetic expression  is a combination of numbers 
and symbols that Python can figure out the value of.
Evaluate  just means “figure out the value of.”
