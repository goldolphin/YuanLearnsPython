【PG】 196 Hello World!

【PG】 Let’s try drawing the circle in the middle of the window. Here’s the program.
impor t pygame, sys
pygame.ini t()
screen = pygame.display.se t_mode([640,480])
screen.fill([255, 255, 255])
pygame.draw.circle(screen, [255,0,0],[320,240], 30, 0) 
pygame.display.flip()
running = True
while running:
    for even t in pygame.even t.get():
        if even t.type == pygame.QUIT: 
            running = False
pygame.qui t()

【PG】 The location [320, 240] is used as the center of the circle. Compare the results of running 
listing 16.3 to the results you saw when you ran listing 16.4 to see the difference.

【PG】 Size of shapes
When you use Pygame’s draw  functions to draw shapes, you have to specify what size to 
make the shape. For a circle, there is only one size: the radius. For something like a 
rectangle, you’d have to specify the length and width. 

【PG】 Pygame has a special kind of object called a rect  (short for rectangle ) that is used for 
defining rectangular areas. You define a rect  using the coordinates of its top-left corner 
and its width and height: Listing 16.4 Putting the circle in the middle of the window
Rect(lef t, top, wid th, heigh t)
Change this from 
[100, 100] to 
[320, 240]
