【PG】397 CHAPTER  25 Skier Explained
The code to do that goes in the main loop, and it looks like this:
hit =  pygame.spri te.spri tecollide(skier, obs tacles, False) 
    if hit:
        if hit[0]. type == "tree" and no t hit[0].passed:  
            poin ts = poin ts - 100                   
            skier.image = pygame.image.load( "skier_crash.png" )     
            anima te()                                             
            pygame. time.delay(1000)                         
            skier.image = pygame.image.load( "skier_down.png" )       
            skier.angle = 0                                         
            speed = [0, 6]                            
            hi t[0].passed = True  
        
        elif hit[0]. type == "flag" and no t hit[0].passed:  
            poin ts += 10                                   
            hi t[0].kill()     
【PG】The variable hit tells us which obstacle sprites the skier sprite collided with. It’s a list, but in our case it has only one item, because the skier can only collide with one obstacle at a time. So the obstacle the skier collided with is hit[0] . 
The passed  variable is used to indicate that a tree has been hit. This ensures that, when the skier continues skiing down the hill, he doesn’t immediately hit the same tree again.
【PG】Now we need to display the score. This takes only three more lines of code. In the initialization section, we create a font  object, which is an instance of Pygame’s Font  class:
In the main loop, we render the font  object with the new score text:
And in the animate()  function, we display the score in the upper-left corner:
【PG】That’s all we need. If you put this all together, you’ll end up with the code from chapter 10, 
in listing 10.1. Only now you understand it a lot better. Understanding how Skier works 
should help you when you’re thinking about and developing your own games.font = pygame.fon t.Fon t(None, 50)
score_ text = fon t.render( "Score: " +str(poin ts), 1, (0, 0, 0))
screen.bli t(score_ text, [10, 10])Check for collisions Hit a tree
