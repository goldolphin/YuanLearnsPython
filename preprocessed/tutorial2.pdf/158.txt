【PG】134 Hello World!

【PG】How can you save a table of data? You already know that you can make a list to hold several 
items. We could put each student’s marks in a list, like this:
Or we could use a list for each subject, like this:
But you might want to collect all the data together in a single data structure . 
To make a single data structure for our class marks, we could do something like this:
This gives us a list of items, where each item is itself a list. We have created a list of lists . Each 
of the items in the classMarks  list is itself a list.

【PG】We could also have created classMarks  directly, without first creating joeMarks , tomMarks , 
and bethMarks , like this:
Now let’s try displaying our data structure. classMarks  has three items, one for each 
student. So we can just loop through them using in:

【PG】>>> joeMarks = [55, 63, 77, 81]
>>> tomMarks = [65, 61, 67, 72]
>>> be thMarks = [97, 95, 92, 88]
>>> ma thMarks = [55, 65, 97]
>>> scienceMarks = [63, 61, 95]
>>> readingMarks = [77, 67, 92]
>>> spellingMarks = [81, 72, 88]
>>> classMarks = [joeMarks, tomMarks, be thMarks]
>>> prin t classMarks
[[55, 63, 77, 81], [65, 61, 67, 72], [97, 95, 92, 88]]
>>> classMarks = [ [55,63,77,81], [65,61,67,72], [97,95,92,88] ]
>>> prin t classMarks
[[55, 63, 77, 81], [65, 61, 67, 72], [97, 95, 92, 88]]
>>> for studen tMarks in classMarks:
        prin t studen tMarks
    
[55, 63, 77, 81]
[65, 61, 67, 72]
[97, 95, 92, 88]

【PG】A data structure  is a way of collecting, storing, or representing the 
data in a program. Data structures can include variables, lists, and 
some other things we haven’t talked about yet. The term data structure 
really refers to the way the data is organized in a program.
