【PG】260 Hello World!
Like some video 
games that have their 
own volume control.I don’t know about you, but it seemed a bit loud to me. I had to turn the volume way down 
on my computer. Let’s find out how to control the sound volume in your programs.

【PG】Controlling volume 
You can control the volume of 
sound on your computer by using 
the volume controls. In Windows, 
this is done with the little speaker 
icon in the system tray. That setting 
controls the volume of all the 
sounds on your computer. You might also have a volume knob on the speakers themselves. 

【PG】But you can also control the volume that Pygame sends to your computer’s sound card. 
And the good thing is, you can control the 
volume of each sound individually—like making 
the music quieter and the “splat” a bit louder, if you want.

【PG】For music, you use pygame.mixer.music.set_volume() . For 
sounds, there’s a set_volume()  method for each sound 
object. In our first example, splat  was the name of our sound 
object, so we’d use splat.set_volume() . The volume is a 
floating-point number from 0 to 1; for example, 0.5 would be 50 
percent or half volume. 

【PG】Now let’s try having music and sound in the same program. How about playing a song and 
then playing the “splat” sound at the end. We’ll also turn down the volume of our sound a 
bit. We’ll set the music to 30 percent and the “splat” sound to 50 percent. The code should 
look something like this.
import pygame, sys
pygame.init()
pygame.mixer.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode([640,480])
pygame.time.delay(1000)
pygame.mixer.music.load( "bg_music.mp3" )
pygame.mixer.music.set_volume(0.30) 
pygame.mixer.music.play()Listing 19.3 Music and sound with volume adjustment
