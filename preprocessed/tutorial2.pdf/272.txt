【PG】248 Hello World!

【PG】for even t in pygame.event.get(): 
        if event.type == QUIT: 
            running = False 
        elif event.type == pygame.MOUSEMOTION:        
            paddle.rect.centerx = event.pos[0]   
    if pygame.sprite.spritecollide(paddle, ballGroup, False):
        myBall.speed[1] = -myBall.speed[1]                     
    myBall.move()                 
    screen.blit(myBall.image, myBall.rect)       
    screen.blit(paddle.image, paddle.rect)        
    pygame.display.flip()

【PG】Here’s what the program should look like when it runs:
Okay, so it’s not the most exciting game, but we’re just getting started with making games in Pygame. Let’s add a few more things to our PyPong game.

Checks for ball hitting paddle
Moves the ball
Redraws everything
