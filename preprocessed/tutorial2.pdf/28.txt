【PG】Hello World!
Why are there 
all those fancy colors 
in IDLE?You are 
now under my 
command! >>> YES MASTERRRRR...

【PG】The figure below shows how that looks in the IDLE window.
Python did what you told it: it printed 
your message. (In programming, print
often means to display text on the screen, 
instead of printing it on a piece of 
paper using your printer.) That
 one line is a Python instruction . 
You’re on your way to 
programming! The computer 
is under your command!

【PG】By the way, in learning to 
program, there is a tradition that 
the first thing you make the computer do is dis -
play “Hello World!” That’s where the title of this 
book comes from. You’re following that tradi -
tion. Welcome to the world of programming!

【PG】Good question! IDLE is trying to help you understand 
things a bit better. It’s showing things in different colors to help 
you tell different parts of the code apart. ( Code  is just another term for 
the instructions you give to the computer in a language like Python.) 
I’ll explain what the different parts are as we go through the rest of 
this book.
