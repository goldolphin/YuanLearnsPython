【PG】57 CHAPTER  6 GUIs—Graphical User Interfaces
【PG】The EasyGui msgbox()  function is used to create a message box. In most cases, the names of 
EasyGui functions are just shortened versions of the English words. 
When you use msgbox() , you should see something that looks like this:
And if you click the OK button, the message box will close.

【PG】GUI input
You just saw a kind of GUI output—a message box. But what about input? You can get input 
with EasyGui too.
When you ran the previous example in interactive mode, did you click the OK button? If you 
did, you should have seen something like this in the shell or terminal or command window:
The 'OK'  part was Python and EasyGui telling you that the user clicked the OK button. 
EasyGui gives you back information to tell you what the user did in the GUI—what button 
she clicked, what she typed, and so on. You can give this response a name (assign it to a 
variable). Try this:
Click OK in the message box to close it. Then type this:
Now the user’s response, OK, has the variable name user_response . Let’s look at a few other 
ways to get input with EasyGui.

【PG】The message box that you just saw is really just one example of something called a dialog 
box. Dialog boxes are GUI elements that are used to tell the user something or get some 
input from the user. The input might be a button click (like OK), or a filename, or some text 
(a string).
The EasyGui msgbox  is a dialog box with a message and a single button, OK. But you can 
have different kinds of dialog boxes with more buttons and other things.>>> impor t easygui
>>> easygui.msgbox( "Hello there!")
'OK'
>>> user_response = easygui.msgbox( "Hello there!")
>>> prin t user_response
OK
