【PG】1Here are some ways to solve these problems. You might have come up with a different way to do the same thing.
a) Calculate how much each person should pay at the restaurant:
Rounding this off, each person should pay $13.52.
b) Calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle:
Here’s a sample run of the program:

【PG】2Here’s a program to convert temperatures from Fahrenheit to Celsius:

【PG】3Calculate the time it will take to drive a certain distance at a given speed:
(Remember to make at least one of the numbers in the division a decimal, unless you want the answer to be rounded down to an integer.)

leng th = 16.7
width = 12.5
Perime ter = 2 * leng th + 2 * wid th
Area = leng th * wid th
