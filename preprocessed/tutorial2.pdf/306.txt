【PG】282 Hello World!
using the same names for our components, which will make it easier to follow the code 
later on.
Don’t worry about getting the components exactly lined up or exactly the same as shown 
here, as long as they’re roughly the same.


【PG】Creating the new GUI
The first step is to make a new PyQt project. When you close the UI you have open 
(MyFirstGui), Designer will open the New Form  window again, and you can make sure 
Main Window  is selected as the type of form, and click Create .
Now you need to start adding widgets: the Celsius entry box is a Line Edit  widget, the 
Fahrenheit entry box is a Spin Box , the labels under each temperature entry box are Label
widgets, and there are two Push Button  components. You’ll have to scroll down in the 
Widget Box on the left side to find some of these. Here are the steps to make the GUI:


【PG】1Find the Push Button  widget in the Widget Box. Drag it over onto the form, and it will 
make a new button on the form. Then do the following:
■Make the button the size you want by dragging the handles or entering new 
numbers in the geometry  properties (like you saw in MyFirstGui).
■Change the button’s objectName  property to btnFtoC .
■Change the button’s text  property to <<< Fahrenheit to Celsius .
■Change the button’s font size  to 12. If you find the font  property in the Property 
Editor and click the little button with three dots in it that looks like this: . 
You’ll get a Font dialog just like one you’ve probably seen in your favorite 
word processor.


【PG】2Drag another Push Button  onto the form, place it above the first button, make it the 
size you want, and change these settings:
■Change the button’s objectName  property to btnCtoF .
■Change the button’s text  property to Celsius to Fahrenheit >>> .
■Change the button’s font size  to 12.


【PG】3Drag a Line Edit  widget onto the form, and place it to the left of the two buttons:
■Change the Line Edit widget’s objectName  property to editCel .


【PG】4Drag a Spin Box  widget onto the form, and place it to the right of the two buttons:
■Change the objectName  of the Spin Box to spinFahr .


【PG】5Drag a Label  widget onto the form, and place it below the Line Edit widget:
■Change the text  property of the label to Celsius .
■Change the label’s font size  to 10.
