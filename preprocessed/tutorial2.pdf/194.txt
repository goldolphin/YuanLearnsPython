【PG】170 Hello World!

【PG】Now, run the code in listing 14.5 and see what you get. It should look like this:
We see that the attributes are cooked_level = 0 , cooked_string = "Raw" , and condiments
is empty.

【PG】Now, let’s test the cook()  method. Add the lines below to the code in listing 14.5:
Run the program again. Now, the output should look like this:
So our cook()  method seems to work. The cooked_level  went from 0 to 4, and the string 
updated too (from Raw to Medium ).>>> 
0 
Raw
[] 
prin t "Now I'm going to cook the ho t dog"    
myDog.cook(4)
prin t myDog.cooked_level   
prin t myDog.cooked_s tring
>>> 
0                   
Raw
[]                
Now I'm going to cook the ho t dog
4   
Medium

【PG】Thinking like a (Python) programmer
Another convention in Python is that the 
name of a class always starts with an 
uppercase (capital) letter. So far we have 
seen Ball and HotDog, so we have been 
following the convention.   print>>>Helloif#print>>>Helloif#print>>>Helloif#
