【PG】CHAPTER  16 Graphics
Because there is no pygame.draw.sinewave()  method, we have to draw it ourselves from 
individual points. One way to do this is to draw tiny circles or rectangles, with a size of just 
one or two pixels. The following listing shows how that would look using rectangles.

impor t pygame, sys
impor t math      
pygame.ini t()
screen = pygame.display.se t_mode([640,480])
screen.fill([255, 255, 255])                                
for x in range(0, 640):  
    y = int(math.sin(x/640.0 * 4 * ma th.pi) * 200 + 240)    
    pygame.draw.rec t(screen, [0,0,0],[x, y, 1, 1], 1)       
pygame.display.flip()
running = True
while running:
    for even t in pygame.even t.get():
        if even t.type == pygame.QUIT: 
            running = False
pygame.qui t()

【PG】To draw each point, we used a rectangle 1 pixel wide by 1 pixel high. Note that we also used 
a line width of 1, not 0. If we used a line width of 0, nothing would show up, because there’s 
no “middle” to fill in.
