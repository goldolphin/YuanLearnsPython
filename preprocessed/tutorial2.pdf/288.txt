【PG】264 Hello World!
More wacky sounds

【PG】Now that we have the hit sound when the ball hits the paddle, let’s add a few other 
sounds. We’ll add sounds for these things:
■When the ball hits the side walls
■When the ball hits the top wall and the player scores a point
■When the player misses the ball and the ball hits the bottom 
■When a new life starts
■When the game ends

【PG】First we need to create sound objects for all of these. You can put the code anywhere after 
pygame.mixer.init()  but before the while  loop:
I picked the volume levels by just trying it out to see what sounded right. You can set them to 
whatever you like. And remember to copy all the sound files to wherever you’re saving your 
code. All of these sounds can be found in the \examples\sounds  folder or on the website.

【PG】Now we need to add the play()  methods to the places where these events occur. The 
hit_wall  sound should happen whenever we hit the sides of the window. We detect this in 
the ball’s move()  method, and we reverse the ball’s x-speed (to make the ball “bounce” off 
the sides). In the original listing 18.5, this is in line 14:
if self.rect.left < 0 or self.rect.right > screen.get_width():
So when we reverse direction, we can also play our sound. The code looks like this:

【PG】We can do the same thing for the get_point  sound. Just a little farther down in the ball’s 
move()  method, we detect the ball hitting the top of the window. That’s where we bounce 
the ball off the window by reversing the ball’s y-speed. The code change looks like this:
