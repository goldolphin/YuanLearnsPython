【PG】CHAPTER 4
Types of Data

We have seen that there are at least three different types of things we can assign to a 
variable (to keep in the computer’s memory): integers, floating-point numbers, and strings. 
There are other types of data in Python, which you’ll learn about later, but for now these 
three will do.

【PG】In this chapter, you’re going to learn how you can tell what type something is. 
You’ll also see how to make one type from another.

【PG】Changing types

Quite often, we need to convert data from one type to another. For instance, when we want 
to print a number, it needs to be converted to text in order for the text to appear on the 
screen. Python’s print  command can do that for us, but sometimes we need to convert 
without printing, or to convert from strings to numbers (which print  can’t do). This is called 
type conversion . So how does it work?

Python doesn’t actually “convert” things from one type to another. It creates a new thing, of 
the type you want, from the original thing. Here are some functions that convert data from 
one type to another:
■float()  will create a new float (decimal number) from a string or integer. 
■int()  will create a new integer from a string or float.
■str()  will create a new string from a number (or any other type).

The parentheses at the end of float() , int() , and str()  are there because they are not 
Python keywords  (like print )—they are some of Python’s built-in functions .
