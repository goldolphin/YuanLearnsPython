【PG】CHAPTER 11 Nested and Variable Loops
The best way to explain this is with an example. Let’s imagine we’re running a hot dog stand 
at our school’s spring fair, and we want to make a poster showing how to order all possible 
combinations of hot dog, bun, ketchup, mustard, and onions by number. So we need to fig -
ure out what all the possible combinations are.

【PG】One way to think about this problem is to use something called a decision tree . The next fig -
ure shows a decision tree for the hot dog problem.
Each decision point has only two choices, Yes or No. Each different path down the tree 
describes a different combination of hot dog parts. The path I highlighted says “Yes” 
for hot dog, “No” for bun, “Yes” for mustard, and “Yes” for ketchup.

【PG】Now we’re going to use nested loops to list all the combinations—all the paths through the 
decision tree. Because there are five decision points, there are five levels in our decision 
tree, so there will be five nested loops in our program. (The figure only shows the first four 
levels of the decision tree.)

【PG】Type the code in the following listing into an IDLE editor window, and save it as hotdog1.py .
prin t "\tDog \ tBun \ tKetchup\ tMustard\ tOnions"
coun t = 1
for dog in [0, 1]:                                             
    for bun in [0, 1]:                                         
        for ketchup in [0, 1]:                                  
            for mustard in [0, 1]:                             
                for onion in [0, 1]:                           
                    prin t "#", coun t, "\t",                    
                    prin t dog, "\t", bun, "\t", ke tchup, "\t",
                    prin t mustard, "\t", onion                 
                    coun t = coun t + 1                        Listing 11.6 Hot dog combinationsStart
