【PG】44 Hello World!

【PG】Getting more information: type()

In the last section, we relied on seeing the quote marks to know that a value was a number 
or a string. There is a more direct way to find out.

Python has another function, type() , which explicitly tells us the type of a variable. 
Let’s try it:

The type()  function tells us that a is of type 'str' , which stands for string , and b is of type 
'float' . No more guessing!

【PG】Type-conversion errors

Of course, if we give int()  or float()  something that is not a number, it won’t work. 
Try it and see:

We got an error message. The error message means that Python doesn’t know how to 
create a number from “fred” . Do you?

【PG】Using type conversions

Going back to your Fahrenheit to Celsius temperature-conversion program from the “Try it 
out” section in chapter 3, remember that you needed to fix the integer-division behavior to 
get the right answer, by changing the 5 to 5.0 or the 9 to 9.0:

The float()  function gives you another way of doing this:
or 
Try it and see.

>>> a = '44.2'
>>> b = 44.2
>>> type(a)
<type 's tr'>
>>> type(b)
<type 'floa t'>
>>> prin t floa t('fred')
Traceback (mos t recen t call las t):
  File "<pyshell#1>", line 1, in <module>
    prin t floa t('fred')
ValueError: could no t conver t string to floa t: fred
cel = 5.0 / 9 * (fahr - 32)
cel = floa t(5) / 9 * (fahr - 32)
cel = 5 / floa t(9) * (fahr - 32)
