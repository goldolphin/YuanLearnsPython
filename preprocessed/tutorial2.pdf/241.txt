【PG】Sprites and Collision Detection

【PG】In this chapter, we’ll continue using Pygame to do animation. We’ll look at things called 
sprites,  which help us keep track of lots of images moving on the screen. We’ll also see how 
to detect when two images overlap or hit each other, like when a ball hits a paddle or a 
spaceship hits an asteroid.

【PG】Sprites

【PG】In the last chapter, you saw that simple animation isn’t quite so simple after all. If you have 
a lot of images and are moving them around, it can be a lot of work keeping track of what’s 
“under” each image so you can repaint when you move the image. In our first example with 
the beach ball, the background was just white, so it was easier. But you can imagine that, 
with graphics in the background, it would get more complicated. 

【PG】Fortunately, Pygame provides some extra help. The individual images or parts of an image 
that move around are called sprites , and Pygame has a special module for handling sprites. 
This lets you move graphical objects around more easily. 

【PG】In the last chapter, we had a beach ball bouncing around the screen. What if we want a 
whole bunch of beach balls bouncing around? We could write the code to manage each 
ball individually, but instead we’re going to use Pygame’s sprite  module to make things 
easier.
