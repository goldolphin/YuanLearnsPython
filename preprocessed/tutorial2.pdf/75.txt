【PG】51 CHAPTER  5 Input
We can also combine the last three lines of listing 5.3 into one, like this:
This is really just shorthand for the three print  statements we had before.

【PG】Using int()  with raw_input()
If the number you want the user to enter will always be an integer (no decimals), you can 
convert it with int() , like this:prin t "Tha t is", celsius, "degrees Celsius"
response = raw_inpu t("How many s tuden ts are in your class: " )
numberOfS tuden ts = int(response) 

【PG】Thinking like a (Python) programmer
There is another way to get numbers as 
input. Python 2 has a function called 
input() that gives you a number 
directly, so you don’t have to use int()
or float()to convert it. We used it 
in the number-guessing program in 
chapter 1, because it is the simplest 
way to get a number from the user. 
But to keep things consistent, we will 
always use raw_input()  for the rest of 
this book. Also, the input() function 
(the one that gets numbers directly 
without having to convert them) is 
removed in Python 3. There is only 
raw_input() . To make things just 
a little more confusing, the Python 2 
raw_input()  function is called input() in 
Python 3, but it is the same function 
that you saw in this chapter, the one 
that only gets strings. Because you know 
how to create a number from a string, 
I recommend you use raw_input()  instead 
of input() in Python 2.
