【PG】118 Hello World!

【PG】If I asked you to write down your lucky numbers, you might write this:
In Python, you’d write this:

【PG】Both family  and luckyNumbers  are examples of Python lists, and the individual things 
inside lists are called items . As you can see, lists in Python aren’t much different from lists 
you make in everyday life. Lists use square brackets to show where the list starts and ends, 
and they use commas to separate the items inside. 

【PG】Creating a list
Both family  and luckyNumbers  are variables. We said before that you can assign different 
kinds of values to variables. We have already used them for numbers and strings, and they 
can also be assigned a list. 
You create a list like you create any other variable—by assigning something to it, just like 
we did with luckyNumbers . You can also create an empty list, like this:
There are no items inside the square brackets, so the list is empty. But what good is an 
empty list? Why would you want to create one?

【PG】Well, quite often, you don’t know ahead of time what’s going to be in a list. You don’t know 
how many items will be in it, or what those items will be. You just know you’ll be using a list 
to hold them. Once you have an empty list, the program can add things to it. So how do you 
do that?

【PG】Adding things to a list
To add things to a list, you use append() . Try this in interactive mode:
You’ll get this result:luckyNumbers = [2, 7, 14, 26, 30]
newLis t = []
>>> friends = []
>>> friends.append( 'David')
>>> prin t friends
['David']Makes a new, empty list
Adds an item, 
"David", to the list
