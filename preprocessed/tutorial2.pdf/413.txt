【PG】If you run listing 25.1, you’ll see just the skier (no score, no obstacles), and you’ll be able to 
turn him left and right.

【PG】The obstacles
The next thing we’ll do is figure out how to make the obstacles—the trees and flags. For 
this part, to keep things simple, we’re going to start from scratch again—no skier, just the 
obstacles. We’ll put the skier code together with the obstacle code at the end.

【PG】The window for the skier game is 640 x 640 pixels. To keep things simple and prevent 
having obstacles too close together, we divide the window into a 10 x 10 grid. There are 100 Left arrow turns left
