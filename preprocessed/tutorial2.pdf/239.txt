【PG】Try it out
1We talked about drawing circles and rectangles. Pygame also has methods to draw lines, arcs, ellipses, and polygons. Try using these to draw some other shapes in a program.
You can find out more about these methods in the Pygame documentation at www.pygame.org/docs/ref/draw.html . If you don’t have Internet access, you can also find it on your hard drive (it’s installed with Pygame), but it can be hard to find. Search your hard drive for a file called pygame_draw.html . 
You can also use Python’s help system (which we talked about at the end of chapter 6). One thing SPE doesn’t have is an interactive shell that works, so start IDLE and type the following:
>>> impor t pygame
>>> help()
help> pygame.draw600400A
