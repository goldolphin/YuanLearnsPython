【PG】87 CHAPTER 8 Loop the Loop

【PG】Counting by steps
So far, your counting loops have been counting up by 1 each iteration. What if you want the 
loop to count in steps of 2? Or 5, or 10? What about counting backward? The range()  
function can have an extra argument  that allows you to change the size of the steps from 
the default of 1 to a different size. 

【PG】Let’s try some loops in interactive mode. When you type in the first line, with the colon 
at the end, IDLE will automatically indent the next line for you, because it knows that a 
for loop needs a block of code following it. When you complete the block of code, press 
the Enter  (or Return ) key twice. Try it:
We added a third parameter, 2, to the range()  function. Now the loop is counting in steps 
of 2. Let’s try another one:

【PG】>>> for i in range(1, 10, 2):
        prin t i
1
3
5
7
9
>>> for i in range(5, 26, 5):
        prin t i
    
5
10
15
20
25

【PG】Arguments  are the values that you put inside the parentheses when you use a function 
like range(). We say that you pass the argument to the function. The term  parameter  is 
also used, as in, “pass the parameter.” We’ll learn more about functions, arguments, and 
parameters in chapter 13.
