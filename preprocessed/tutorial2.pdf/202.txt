【PG】This is the last chapter that talks about ways of collecting things together. We have already 
learned about lists, functions , and objects . In this chapter, we’ll learn about modules . In the 
next chapter, we’ll use a module called Pygame to start drawing some graphics.

【PG】What’s a module?
A module  is a piece or part of something. We say 
something is modular  if it comes in pieces or you 
can easily separate it into pieces. LEGO blocks 
might be the perfect example of something modu -
lar. You can take a bunch of different pieces and 
build many different things with them.

【PG】In Python, modules are smaller pieces of a bigger program. Each module, or piece, is a 
separate file on your hard drive. You can take a big program and split it up into more than 
one module, or file. Or you can go the other way—start with one small module and keep 
adding pieces to make a big program.

【PG】Why use modules?
So why go to all the trouble of splitting a program up into smaller pieces, when you’re 
going to need them all to make the program work? Why not just leave everything in one 
big file?
