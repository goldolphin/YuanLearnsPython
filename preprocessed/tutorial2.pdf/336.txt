【PG】Test your knowledge

1If you have two separate print statements, like this
how would you make everything print on the same line?
2How can you add extra blank lines when printing something?
3What special printing code do you use to line things up in columns?
4What format string do you use to force a number to print in E-notation?

【PG】Try it out

1Write a program that asks for a person’s name, age, and favorite color, and then prints 
them out in one sentence. A run of the program should look like this:

What is your name? Sam
How old are you? 12
What is your favorite color? green
Your name is Sam. You are 12 years old and you like green.

2Remember our times-table program from chapter 8 (listing 8.5)? Write an improved 
version that uses tabs to make sure everything lines up nicely in columns.
3Write a program that calculates all the fractions of 8 (for example, 1/8, 2/8, 3/8, … up 
to 8/8) and displays them with exactly three decimal places.

【PG】print "What is"
print "your name?"
