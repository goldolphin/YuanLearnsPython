【PG】Here is a program that will get five names, put them in a list, and then print
them out:

nameList = []
print "Enter 5 names (press the Enter key after each name):"
for i in range(5):
    name = raw_input()
    nameList.append(name)
print "The names are:", nameList

【PG】Here is a program that will print the original list and a sorted version:

nameList = []
print "Enter 5 names (press the Enter key after each name):"
for i in range(5):
    name = raw_input()
    nameList.append(name)
print "The names are:", nameList
print "The sorted names are:", sorted(nameList)

【PG】Here is a program to print only the third name in the list:

nameList = []
print "Enter 5 names (press the Enter key after each name):"
for i in range(5):
    name = raw_input()
    nameList.append(name)
print "The third name is:", nameList[2]

【PG】Here is a program to allow the user to replace a name in the list:

nameList = []
print "Enter 5 names (press the Enter key after each name):"
for i in range(5):
    name = raw_input()
    nameList.append(name)
print "The names are:", nameList

print "Replace one name. Which one? (1-5):",
replace = int(raw_input())
new = raw_input("New name: ")
nameList[replace - 1] = new
print "The names are:", nameList
