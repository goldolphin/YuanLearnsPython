【PG】325 CHAPTER  22 File Input and Output
【PG】Correction! You can open a file for appending if it’s not there. It’ll just create a new one that’s blank! Carter is right, again ! 
【PG】If you use 'w' for write  mode, there are two possibilities:
■If the file already exists, whatever is in the file will be lost and replaced with whatever you write there.
■If the file doesn’t exist, a new file with that name will be created, and whatever you write will go into the new file.
【PG】Let’s look at some examples.

【PG】Appending to a file
First we’ll take the notes.txt  file that we created earlier and append  something to it. Let’s add another line that says “Spend allowance. ” If you were looking closely when we did the readlines()  example, you might have noticed that there’s no \n, no newline , at the end of the last line. So we need to add one, and then add our new string. To write strings to a file, we use the write()  method, like this.
todo_lis t = open('notes.txt', 'a')                 
todo_lis t.write('\nSpend allowance' )               
todo_lis t.close() 
When we were reading files, I said you should close the file when you’re done. But it’s even more important to use close()  when you’re done writing . That’s because the changes don’t actually get saved to the file until you close()  it. After you run the program in listing 22.3, open notes.txt  using Notepad (or any other text 
editor) and see what’s in it. Remember to close Notepad when you’re done.

【PG】Writing to a file
Now let’s try an example of writing to a file using the write mode. We’ll open a file that isn’t on the hard drive. Type in the program in this listing and run it.
