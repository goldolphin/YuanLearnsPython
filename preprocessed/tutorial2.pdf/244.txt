【PG】220 Hello World!

【PG】for ball in balls:
    screen.bli t(ball.image, ball.rec t)
pygame.display.flip()

【PG】running = True
while running:
    for even t in pygame.even t.get():
        if even t.type == pygame.QUIT: 
            running = False
pygame.qui t()

【PG】If you run this, you should 
see nine beach balls 
appear in the Pygame 
window, like this:

【PG】In a minute, we’ll start moving them around.

【PG】Did you notice the small change in lines 10 and 11, which set the size of the Pygame 
window? We replaced 
with 

【PG】This code not only sets the size of the window—like before—but also defines two variables, 
width  and height , which we can use later. The neat thing here is that we have defined a list, 
called size , with two items in it, and we have also defined two integer variables, width  and screen = pygame.display.se t_mode([640,480])
size = wid th, heigh t = 640, 480
screen = pygame.display.se t_mode(size)
