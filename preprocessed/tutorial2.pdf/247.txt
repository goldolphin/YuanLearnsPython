【PG】223 CHAPTER  17 Sprites and Collision Detection

【PG】This program uses a list to keep track of all the balls. In line 32 ( balls.append(ball) ), each 
ball is added to the list as it’s created. 
The code in the last five lines redraws the screen. Here we cheat a bit, and instead of “
erasing” (painting over) each ball separately, we just fill the window with white and then 
redraw all the balls.
You can experiment with this code by having more (or fewer) balls, changing their speed, 
changing how they move and “bounce, ” and so on. You’ll notice that the balls move around 
and bounce off the sides of the window, but they don’t bounce off each other—yet!

【PG】Bump! Collision detection 

【PG】In most computer games, you need to know when one sprite hits another one. For example, 
you might need to know when a bowling ball hits the pins or when your missile hits the 
spaceship. 
You might be thinking that, if you know the position and size of every sprite, you can write 
some code to check those against the position and size of every other sprite, to see where 
they overlap. But the folks who wrote Pygame have already done that for us. Pygame has 
what’s called collision detection  built in. Adds each ball to the 
list as it’s created
Redraws the screen
Collision detection  simply means knowing when two sprites are 
touching or overlapping. When two things that are moving run 
into each other, it’s called a collision.
