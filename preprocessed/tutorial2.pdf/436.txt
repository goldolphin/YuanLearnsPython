【PG】412 Hello World!

【PG】Python can take you a long way, but to do some specific things you may need a different language, like C, C++, Java, JavaScript (different from Java), or another one. If so, you’ll want to find a book or other resource that teaches you that specific language. There are so many different ones out there that I can’t give you much advice on that subject.

【PG】Whatever you do, have fun with programming! Keep learning, exploring, and experimenting. The more you learn about programming, the more interesting it gets!

【PG】Bye for now!
