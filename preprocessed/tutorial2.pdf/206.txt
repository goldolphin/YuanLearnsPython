【PG】182 Hello World!

【PG】there’s only one name “Shawn. ” Your class is your namespace , and in that namespace, there’s 
only one Shawn, so there’s no confusion.

【PG】Now, if the principal has to call Shawn to the office over the public address system, she 
can’t just say, “Would Shawn please come to the office. ” If she did that, both Shawns would 
show up at the office. For the principal using the public address system, the namespace is 
the whole school. That means everyone in the school is listening for the name, not just one 
class. So she has to be more specific about which Shawn she means. She would have to say 
something like, “Would Shawn from Mr. Morton’s class please come to the office. ”

【PG】Shawn has a new backpack!
