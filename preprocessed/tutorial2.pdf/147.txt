【PG】123 CHAPTER  12 Collecting Things Together—Lists and Dictionaries
【PG】Displaying the type  of each one tells you for certain that in one case you get a single item 
(a string , in this case), and in the other case you get a list.

【PG】The smaller list you get back when you slice a list is a copy of items from the original list. 
That means you can change it and the original list won’t be affected.

【PG】Slice shorthand
There are some shortcuts you can take when using slices. They don’t really save you much 
typing, but programmers are a lazy bunch, so they use shortcuts a lot. I want you to know 
what the shortcuts are, so you can recognize them when you see them in other people’s 
code and understand what’s going on. That’s important, because looking at other people’s 
code and trying to understand it is a good way to learn a new programming language, or 
programming in general.

【PG】If the slice you want includes the start of the list, the shortcut is to use a colon followed by 
the number of items you want, like this: 
Notice that there is no number before the colon. This will give you everything from the start 
of the list up to (but not including) the index you specify. 

【PG】You can do something similar to get the end of a list:
Using a number followed by a colon gives you everything from the index you specify to the 
end of the list.

【PG】If you don’t put any numbers in, and just use a colon, you get the whole list:
Remember I said that slices make a copy of the original? So letters[:]  makes a copy of the 
whole list. This is handy if you want to make some changes to a list but keep the original 
unchanged.>>> prin t letters[:2]
['a', 'b']
>>> prin t letters[2:]
['c', 'd', 'e']
>>> prin t letters[:]
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
