【PG】Hotkeys
We said before that one reason some people prefer using menus to using buttons is that 
they can use menus with the keyboard, without having to use the mouse. Right now, our 
menus work with the mouse, but we haven’t made them work with the keyboard yet. The 
way we do that is by adding hotkeys.

Hotkeys  (also called shortcut keys ) let you select menu items by using only the keyboard. In 
Windows and Linux, you activate the menu system by using the Alt key. (We’ll talk about 
Mac OS in a minute.) When you press the Alt key, 
you’ll see a certain letter of each menu item 
highlighted, usually with an underline. The 
underlined letter is the one you use to activate 
that menu. So, for instance, to get into the File 
menu, you press Alt-F . That is, you hold down Alt 
and then press the F key. Once you have done 
that, you can see the items in the File menu, and 
you can see what the hotkeys are for each menu 
item. Try this with the IDLE shell window:
To open a new window, you use Alt-F-N . (Hold 
Down Alt, press F, and then press N.)

【PG】Now, we’re going to define hotkeys in the menu for the temperature-conversion GUI. To 
define a hotkey, all you have to do is put the & character in front of the letter that you want 
to be the hotkey. You do this in the Title  property for a menu (like File) or in the Text
property for a menu item (like Exit ). For the File menu, the convention is to make F the 
hotkey; and for Exit , make X the hot key. So File becomes &File , and Exit  becomes E&xit .
