【PG】E-notation: %e and %E
When we talked about E-notation (in chapter 3), I promised I’d show you how to make 
numbers print using E-notation. Well, here it is:
The %e format string is used to print E-notation. It always prints six decimal places unless 
you tell it otherwise. 
You can print more or fewer decimal places by using a .n after the %, just like you can 
with floats:
The %.3e  rounded off to three decimal places, and the %.8e  added some zeroes to make up 
the extra digits.
You can use a lowercase or uppercase e, and the output will use the same case you used in 
the format string:

【PG】Automatic float or E-notation: %g and %G
If you want Python to automatically choose float notation or E-notation for you, use 
the %g format string. Again, if you use uppercase, you’ll get an uppercase E in 
the output:
Did you notice how Python automatically chose E-notation for the big number and regular 
floating-point notation for the smaller number?>>> number = 12.3456
>>> prin t '%e' % number
1.234560e+01
>>> number = 12.3456
>>> prin t '%.3e' % number
1.235e+01
>>> prin t '%.8e' % number
1.23456000e+01
>>> prin t '%E' % number
1.234560E+01
>>> number1 = 12.3
>>> number2 = 456712345.6
>>> prin t '%g' % number1
12.3
>>> prin t '%g' % number2
4.56712e+08
