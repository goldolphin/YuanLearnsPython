【PG】198 Hello World!

【PG】Notice that we only pass four arguments to pygame.draw.rect . That’s because the rect  has both location and size in a single argument. In pygame.draw.circle , the location and size are two different arguments, so we pass it five arguments.

【PG】Line width

【PG】The last thing you need to specify when drawing shapes is how thick to make the line. In the examples so far, we used a line width of 0, which fills in the whole shape. If we used a different line width, we’d see an outline of the shape. Try changing the line width to 2: Try it and see how it looks. Try other line widths too.

【PG】Modern art? 

【PG】Want to try making some computer-generated modern art? Just for fun, try the code in listing 16.5. You can start with what you had from listing 16.4 and modify it, or start from scratch.pygame.draw.rec t(screen, [255,0,0], [250, 150, 300, 200], 2)#!/bin/envpython#Paginateatextfile,addingaheaderandfooterimportsys,time,string#Ifnoargumentsweregiven,printahelpfulmessageiflen(sys.argv)!=2:print'Usage:pyprintfilename'sys.exit(0)class#Incrementthepagecount,andresetthelinecountself.header_written=1;self.count=

【PG】Thinking like a (Pygame) programmer

【PG】Once you create a rectangle with Rect(left, top, width, height), there are several other attributes that you can use to move and align the Rect: These are just for convenience. So, if you want to move a rectangle so that its center is at a certain point, you don’t have to figure out what the top and left coordinates should be; you can access the center location directly. 

 the four edges:  top, left, bottom, right

 the four corners:  topleft, bottomleft, topright, bottomright

 the middle of each side:  midtop, midleft, midbottom, midright

 the center:  center, centerx, centery  

 dimensions:  size, width, height
