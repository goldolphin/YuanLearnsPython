【PG】274 Hello World!

【PG】On the left is the Widget Box, where 
you see all the different graphical 
elements you can use in your GUI. 
They are grouped into a few different 
categories.

【PG】On the right are the Object Inspector and Property Editor. These are where you can examine 
and change the properties of the widgets. There is also a third box whose function is 
selected by the tabs at the bottom. It can be the Signal/Slot Inspector, Action Editor, or 
Resource Browser.

【PG】In the middle is the new, blank form you just created. It says Main Window – untitled  at the 
top, because you haven’t given it a name yet. This blank space is where you will put the 
widgets to make up your UI. (On a Mac, to get this view you’ll need to go into Qt Designer > 
Preferences  and change the user interface mode from Multiple Top-Level Windows to 
Docked Window. Otherwise all the panes will float in separate windows.)

【PG】Adding a button
Let’s add a button to the GUI. On the left side of the Qt Designer 
window, find the Buttons  section, and look for the Push Button
widget.

【PG】Drag the  Push Button  over to the blank form, and drop it some -
where. Now you have a button on your form, and it has the label 
PushButton .

【PG】Now look over on the right side, 
at the Property Editor. If the 
button is still selected (if it has 
the little blue squares around 
it), then you will see its 
properties in the Property 
Editor. You can see that the 
name of the button is 
PushButton . If you scroll 
through some of the other 
properties in the Properties list, 
you can see things like the 
button’s width and height, its 
x and y position, and so on.

【PG】In a GUI, the individual buttons, check 
boxes, and so on, are called widgets. 
They’re also referred to as components , 
and sometimes as controls .
