【PG】The colon ( :) at the end of the if line tells Python that a block  of instructions is coming 
next. The block includes every line that is indented  from the if line, up until the next line 
that is not indented. 
【PG】If the condition is true , everything in the following block  will be done. In the previous short 
example, the second and third lines make up the block  of statements for the if in the first 
line.

Now might be a good time to talk about indenting  and blocks  of code.
Indenting
In some languages, indenting is just a matter of style—you can indent however you like (or 
not at all). But in Python, indenting is a necessary part of how you write the code. Indenting 
tells Python where blocks of code start and where they end.A block of code is one or more lines of code that 
are grouped together. They’re all related to a 
particular part of the program (like an if statement). 
In Python, blocks of code are formed by indenting the 
lines of code in the block.

it has some spaces at the beginning, so it starts 
a few characters away from the left side.
