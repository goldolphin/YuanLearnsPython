【PG】CHAPTER 2 1
Print Formatting and Strings

【PG】Waaaayyyy back in chapter 1, you learned about the print  statement. It was the first com -
mand you ever used in Python. You’ve also seen (in chapter 5) that you can put a comma at 
the end of a print  statement to make Python keep printing the next thing on the same line. 
(At least, in Python 2. Not in Python 3.) You used that to make prompts for raw_input() , 
until you learned the shortcut of putting the prompt right in the raw_input()  function. 

【PG】In this chapter, we’re going to look at print formatting —ways to make your program’s output 
look the way you want it to. We’ll look at things like
■Starting new lines (and when you should do that)
■Spacing things out horizontally (and lining things up in columns)
■Printing variables in the middle of a string
■Formatting numbers in integer, decimal, or E-notation format, and setting how many 
decimal places they should have

【PG】You’ll also learn about some of Python’s built-in methods for working with strings. These 
methods can do things like
■Splitting strings into smaller parts
■Joining strings together
■Searching for strings
■Searching within strings
■Removing parts of strings
■Changing case (uppercase and lowercase)
