【PG】127 CHAPTER  12 Collecting Things Together—Lists and Dictionaries

【PG】Deleting with pop()
pop()  takes the last item off the list and gives it back to you. That means you can assign 
it a name, like this:
You can also use pop()  with an index, like this:
Here, we popped the second letter (index 1), which was b. The item we popped was 
assigned to second , and it was also removed from letters .

【PG】With nothing inside the parentheses, pop()  gives you the last item and removes it from the 
list. If you put a number in the parentheses, pop(n)  gives you the item at that index and 
removes it from the list.

【PG】Searching a list
Once you have several items in a list, how do you find them? Two things you’ll often need to 
do with a list are
■Find out whether an item is in a list or not
■Find out where an item is in the list (its index)

【PG】The in keyword
To find out whether something is in a list, you use the in keyword, like this:
The 'a' in letters  part is a Boolean  or logical  expression. It’ll return the value True  if a is in 
the list, and False  otherwise.
