【PG】375 CHAPTER  24 Computer Simulations

【PG】■Playing with the pet will make its happiness increase.
■Taking the pet to the doctor will make its health increase.
■The pet will have six different graphics:
■One for sleeping
■One for being awake but doing nothing
■One for walking
■One for playing
■One for eating
■One for going to the doctor
The graphics will use some simple animation. In the next few sections, you’ll see how this 
all goes together in a program.

【PG】The GUI
Carter and I have created a PyQt GUI for our Virtual Pet 
program. It has buttons (actually icons on a toolbar) to do 
the activities. It has progress bars for the vital stats. As you 
can see, there’s also a place to show the graphic of what the 
pet is doing.

【PG】Notice that the title bar of the window says Virtual Pet . How 
do you set the window title? Create a new form in the Qt 
Designer application, and click the MainWindow  object in 
the Object Inspector. Then, in the Property Editor, find the 
property called windowTitle , and change it to Virtual Pet
(or whatever you want to show in the title bar).

【PG】The group of buttons for the activities is a type of PyQt 
widget called Toolbar . The toolbar has actions  in it just like 
a menu does, but the difference with a toolbar is that each 
action has an icon  associated with it.
