【PG】This is everything we need for the player’s turn. In the next section, we’ll make the 
computer smart enough to play Crazy Eights.

【PG】The computer’s turn
After the player’s turn, the computer has to play, so we need to tell the program how to play 
Crazy Eights. It has to follow the same rules as the player, but the program needs to decide 
what card to play. We have to specifically tell it how to handle all possible situations:
■Playing an 8 (and picking a new suit)
■Playing another card
■Drawing

【PG】To make things a bit simpler, we’ll tell the computer to always play an 8 if it has one. This 
might not be the best strategy, but it’s a simple one.
If the computer plays an 8, it must pick the new suit. The easiest way to do that is to count 
the number of cards of each suit in the computer’s hand and pick the suit that it has the 
most of. Again, this isn’t a perfect strategy, but it’s one of the simplest to code.

【PG】If there’s no 8 in the computer’s hand, the program will go through all the cards and see 
which ones are possible plays. Out of these cards, it’ll pick the one with the highest value 
and play that one.
If there’s no option to play a card, the computer will draw. If the computer tries to draw and 
there are no cards left in the deck, the computer is blocked, just like the human player.

【PG】Here’s the code for the computer’s turn, with a few notes of explanation.
