1Remember the countdown-timer program we created in chapter 8? Here it is, to 
refresh your memory:
Modify the program to use a variable loop. The program should ask the user where the
countdown should start, like this:

2Take the program you wrote in question #1, and have it print a row of stars 
beside each number, like this:
(Hint: You probably need to use a nested loop.)for i in range(5):
    for j in range(3):
        prin t '*',
    prin t
impor t time
for i in range (10, 0, -1):
    prin t i
    time.sleep(1)
prin t "BLAST OFF!"
