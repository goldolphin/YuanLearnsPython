【PG】Try it out
1Make a class definition for a BankAccount . It should have attributes for its name (a string), account number (a string or integer), and balance (a float). It should have methods to display the balance, make deposits, and make withdrawals.
2Make a class called InterestAccount that earns interest. It should be a subclass of BankAccount (so it inherits the attributes and methods). It should also have an attribute for interest rate and a method to add interest. To keep things simple, assume that the addInterest() method will be called once each year to calculate the interest and update the balance.
