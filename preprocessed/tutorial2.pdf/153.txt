【PG】129 CHAPTER  12 Collecting Things Together—Lists and Dictionaries

【PG】But a loop can iterate through any list—it doesn’t have to be a list of numbers. Let’s say 
we wanted to print our list of letters with one item on each line. We could do something 
like this:
This time, our loop variable is letter . (Before, we used loop variables like looper  or i, j, and 
k.) The loop iterates over (loops through) all the values in the list, and each time through, 
the current item is stored in the loop variable, letter , and then is displayed.

【PG】Sorting lists
Lists are an ordered  type of collection. This means the items in a list have a certain order, and 
each one has a place (its index). Once you have put items in a list in a certain order, they stay 
in that order unless you change the list with insert() , append() , remove() , or pop() . But that 
order might not be the order you want. You might want a list sorted  before you use it. 
To sort a list, you use the sort()  method:
sort()  automatically sorts strings alphabetically and numbers numerically, from smallest 
to largest.

【PG】It’s important to know that sort()  modifies the list in place. That means it changes the 
original list you give it. It does not  create a new, sorted list. That means you can’t do this:
If you do, you’ll get “None. ” You have to do it in two steps, like this:>>> le tters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
>>> for letter in le tters:
        prin t letter
    
a
b
c
d
e
>>> le tters = ['d', 'a', 'e', 'c', 'b']
>>> prin t letters
['d', 'a', 'e', 'c', 'b']
>>> le tters.sor t()
>>> prin t letters
['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
>>> prin t letters.sor t()
>>> le tters.sor t()
>>> prin t letters
