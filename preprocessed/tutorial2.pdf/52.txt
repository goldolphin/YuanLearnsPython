Basic Math
When we first tried using Python in interactive mode, we saw that it can do simple arithme -
tic. Now we’re going to see what else Python can do with numbers and math. You might not 
realize it, but math is everywhere! Especially in programming, math is used all the time. 
That doesn’t mean you have to be a math whiz to learn program -
ming, but think about it. Every game has a score of some kind 
that has to be added up. Graphics are drawn on the screen 
using numbers to figure out the positions and col-
ors. Moving objects have a direction and speed, 
which are described with numbers. Almost 
any interesting program is going to use 
numbers and math in 
some way. So let’s 
learn some basics 
about math and 
numbers in 
Python.

【PG】By the way, a lot of what we will learn here applies to other programming 
languages, and to other programs like spreadsheets. It’s not only Python that 
does math this way.
