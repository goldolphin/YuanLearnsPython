【PG】374 Hello World! Virtual Pet

【PG】We’re going to make a very simplified Virtual Pet program, which, as we indicated, is a kind of simulation. You can buy virtual-pet toys (like a keychain with a small screen). There are also websites like Neopets and Webkinz, which are forms of virtual pets. All of these, of course, are simulations as well. They mimic the behavior of a living thing and get hungry, lonely, tired, and so on. To keep them happy and healthy, you have to feed them, play with them, or take them to the doctor. 

【PG】Our virtual pet will be a lot simpler and less realistic than the ones you can buy or play online, because I just want to give you the basic idea, and I don’t want the code to get too complicated. But you could take our simple version and expand or enhance it as much as you want.

【PG】Here are the features our program will have:
■The pet will have four different activities that you can do: feed it, walk it, play with it, or take it to the doctor. 
■The pet will have three stats that you can monitor: hunger, happiness, and health.
■The pet can be awake or asleep.
■The pet will get hungrier over time. You can reduce hunger by feeding.
■The pet will get hungry more slowly when it is asleep.
■If the pet is asleep and you do any activity, it will wake up. 
■If the pet gets too hungry, its happiness will decrease.
■If the pet gets very, very hungry, its health will decrease.
■Walking the pet will make both its happiness and health increase.
