【PG】295 CHAPTER  21 Print Formatting and Strings

【PG】print  and the comma

【PG】The print  statement automatically puts a newline at the end of whatever it prints, unless 
you tell it not to. And how do you tell it not to? By adding a comma (like you saw in 
chapter 5):
(Again, this won’t work in Python 3.) Notice that there’s a space between Hi and There . 
When you use a comma to prevent Python from printing the newline, it prints a space 
instead.

【PG】If you want to print two things right together without a space, you can use concatenation , 
which you saw before:
Remember that concatenation is like adding strings together, but it has a special name 
because “adding” is only for numbers. 

【PG】Adding our own newlines

【PG】What if you want to add your own newlines? For example, what if you want an extra row of 
space between Hi and There ? The easiest way is just to add an extra print  statement:

【PG】When you run it, you’ll get this:prin t 'Hi',
prin t 'There'
>>> =================== RESTART ===================
>>> 
Hi There

【PG】prin t 'Hi' + 'There'
>>> =================== RESTART ===================
>>> 
HiThere

【PG】prin t "Hi"
prin t
prin t "There"
>>> =================== RESTART ===================
>>> 
Hi
There
