【PG】430 Hello World!

【PG】Chapter 8: Loop the Loop

【PG】Test your knowledge
1The loop would run five times.
2The loop would run three times, and the values would be as follows: i = 1, i = 3, i = 5.
3range(1, 8)  would give you [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] .
4range(8)  would give you [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] .
5range(2, 9, 2)  would give you [2, 4, 6, 8] .
6range (10, 0, -2)  would give you  [10, 8, 6, 4, 2] .
7You use continue  to stop the current iteration of a loop and jump ahead to the next 
iteration.
8A while  loop ends when the condition being tested is false .

1Here is a program to print a multiplication table of the user’s choice using a for loop:
2Here is the same multiplication table using a while  loop:
3Here is the multiplication table with a user-defined range: 
Notice in the for line that the second thing in range()  includes a variable, not just a 
number. You will learn more about that in chapter 11.

# program to prin t mul tiplica tion table up to 10
number = int(raw_inpu t('Which table would you like? ' ))
prin t 'Here is your table:'
for i in range(1, 11):
    prin t number, 'x', i, '=', number * i

# program to prin t mul t table (while loop)
number = int(raw_inpu t('Which table would you like? ' ))
prin t 'Here is your table:'
i = 1
while i <= 10:
    prin t number, 'times', i, '=', number * i
    i = i + 1

# program to prin t mul tiplica tion table
# user inpu ts how high they wan t it to go
number = int(raw_inpu t('Which table would you like? ' ))
limi t = int(raw_inpu t('How high would you like i t to go? '))
prin t 'Here is your table:'
for i in range(1, limi t + 1):   
    prin t number, 'times', i, '=', number * i
