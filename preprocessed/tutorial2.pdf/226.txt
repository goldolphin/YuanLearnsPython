【PG】202 Hello World!
Connect the dots

【PG】If you look really closely, you might notice that the sine wave isn’t continuous—there are 
spaces between the points in the middle. That’s because, at the steep part of the sine wave, 
we have to move up (or down) by 3 pixels when we move one pixel to the right. And because 
we’re drawing individual points, not lines, there’s nothing to fill the space in between. 

【PG】Let’s try the same thing using a short line to join each plot point. Pygame has a method to 
draw a single line, but it also has a method that will draw lines between a series of points (like 
“connect the dots”). That method is pygame.draw.lines() , and it needs five parameters:
■The surface  to draw on.
■A color .
■Whether the shape will be closed  by drawing a line joining the last point back to the 
first one. We don’t want to enclose our sine wave, so this will be False  for us.
■A list  of points to connect.
■The width  of the line.

【PG】So in our sine wave example, the pygame.draw.lines()  method would look like this:
In the for loop, instead of drawing each point, we’ll just create the list of points that 
draw.lines()  will connect. Then we have a single call to draw.lines() , which is outside the 
for loop. The whole program is shown next.
