【PG】320 Hello World!

【PG】Reading a file
As I mentioned in the last section, you open a file and create a file object using the open()
function. This is one of Python’s built-in functions. To open the file for reading, you use 'r'
as the second argument, like this:

【PG】If you try to open a file for reading that does not exist, you’ll get an error. (After all, you can’t 
read something that’s not there, right?)

【PG】Python has a couple more built-in functions for getting information from the file into your 
program once the file is open. To read lines of text from a file, you can use the readlines()
method, like this:
This will read the whole file and make a list, with one line of text in each item of the list. 

【PG】Let’s say the notes.txt  file contained a short list of things we need to do today:
We could have used a program like Notepad to create this file. In fact, why don’t you make a 
file like this using Notepad (or your favorite text editor) right now? Call it notes.txt , and 
save it in the same place you save your Python programs. Then close Notepad.

【PG】If we open this file with a short Python program and read it, the code might look like this.
my_file = open('notes.txt', 'r')
lines = my_file.readlines()
print lines
The output would be like this (depending on what you put in the file):
The lines of text were read from the file, and they were put into a list, which we called 
lines . Each item in the list is a string containing one line from the file. Notice the \n part at
