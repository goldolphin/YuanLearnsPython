【PG】Thinking like a programmer
Depending on what operating system you 
are using (Windows, Linux, or Mac OS X), 
you might see little squares or something 
like \r at the end of each line when you 
try running the program in listing 5.4. The 
reason is that different operating systems 
use different ways to indicate the end of 
a line of text. 

Windows (and MS-DOS before it) use two characters: CR 
(Carriage Return) and LF (Line Feed). 
Linux uses just LF. Mac OS X uses just CR.

Some programs can handle any of these, 
but some, like IDLE, get confused if they 
don’t see exactly the line-ending characters 
they are expecting. When that happens, they 
display a little square, which means, “I 
don’t understand this character.”

You might or might not see the little squares, 
depending on what operating system you 
are using and how you run the program 
(using IDLE or some other method).
