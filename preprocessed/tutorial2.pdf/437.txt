Variable Naming Rules

【PG】Here are the rules for variable names (also called identifiers):
■They must begin with either a letter or an underscore character. Following that, you 
can use an unlimited sequence of letters, numbers, or underscore characters. 
■The letters can be uppercase or lowercase, and case matters. In other words, Ax is not 
the same as aX. 
■The numbers can be any of the digit characters from 0 to 9 inclusive.

【PG】Aside from letters, numbers, and the underscore character, no other characters can be used. 
Spaces, punctuation, and other characters are not allowed in variable names:
The only special character that’s allowed is the underscore character. In case you don’t 
know what that is, here are a couple of examples:
■first_number = 15
■student_name = "John"
The character between first  and number  is the underscore. There’s also one between 
student  and name . Programmers sometimes use an underscore to separate two words in 
the name of a variable. Because spaces aren’t allowed in variable names, they use the 
underscore instead.
