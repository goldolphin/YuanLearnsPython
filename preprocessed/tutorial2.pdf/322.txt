【PG】Inserting variables in strings

Up until now, when you wanted to put a variable in the middle of a string, you did 
something like this:
 
If we ran that code, we’d get this:

But there’s another way to insert variables into strings that gives you more control over how 
they’ll look, especially numbers. You can use format strings , which use the percent sign ( %). 

【PG】Let’s say you want to insert a string variable in the middle of a print  statement, like we just did. The way to do it with format strings is like this:

The % sign is used in two places. It’s used in the middle of the string to say where the 
variable will go. Then it’s used again after the string to tell Python that the variable you 
want to insert in the string is coming next.

The %s means it’s a string variable you want to insert. For an integer, you’d use %i; for a float, 
you’d use %f. 

【PG】Here are a couple more examples:

When you run this, you’ll get the following:

Here’s another one:

When you run this, you’ll get the following:

name = 'Warren Sande'

prin t 'My name is %s and I wro te this book' % name

age = 13

prin t 'I am %i years old.' % age

average = 75.6

prin t 'The average on our ma th test was %f percen t.' % average

The average on our ma th test was 75.600000 percen t.
