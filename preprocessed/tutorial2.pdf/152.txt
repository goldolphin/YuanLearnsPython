【PG】128 Hello World!

【PG】You can try this in interactive mode:
This is telling us that the list called letters  does have an item a, but it does not have an 
item s. So a is in the list, and s isn’t in the list. Now you can combine in and remove() , and 
write something that won’t give you an error, even if the value isn’t in the list:
This code only removes the value from the list if the value is in the list.

【PG】Finding the index
To find where in the list an item is located, you use the index()  method, like this:
So we know that d has index 3, which means it’s the fourth item in the list.
Just like remove() , index()  will give you an error if the value isn’t found in the list, so it’s a 
good idea to use it with in, like this:

【PG】Looping through a list
When we first talked about loops, you saw that loops iterate through a list of values. You 
also learned about the range()  function and used it as a shortcut for generating lists of 
numbers for your loops. You saw that range()  gives you a list of numbers.

【PG】>>> 'a' in le tters
True
>>> 's' in le tters
False
if 'a' in le tters:
    le tters.remove( 'a')
>>> le tters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
>>> prin t letters.index( 'd')
3
if 'd' in le tters:
    prin t letters.index( 'd')

【PG】Boolean is a kind of arithmetic that only uses two 
values: 1 and 0, or true and false. It was invented by 
mathematician George Boole, and it is used when combining 
true and false conditions (represented by 1 and 0) 
together with and, or, and not, like we saw in Chapter 7.
