【PG】38 Hello World!

【PG】Exponents vs. E-notation
Don’t get confused between raising a number to a power (also called exponentiation ) and E-notation:
■3**5 means 35, or “three to the fifth power” or 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 * 3, which is equal to 243.
■3e5 means 3 * 105 or “three times ten to the fifth power, ” or 3 * 10 * 10 * 10 * 10 *10, which is equal to 300,000.
■Raising to a power means you are raising the number itself to that power. E-notation means you are multiplying by a power of 10. 
Some people would read both 3e5 and 3**5 as “three exponent five, ” but they are two different things. It doesn’t matter so much how you say it, as long as you understand what each one means.

【PG】What did you learn?
In this chapter, you learned
■How to do basic math operations in Python
■About integers and floats
■About exponentiation (raising numbers to a power)
■How to calculate the modulus (the remainder)
■All about E-notationIf you don’t quite understand how E-notation works, don’t worry. It’s not used for the programs in the rest of this book. I just wanted to show you how it works in case you ever need it.

【PG】At least now, if you use Python to do some math and you get a number like 5.673745e16 for an answer, you will know that it is a really big number, and not some kind of error.Yeah, Mon! 
No worries, eh? This programming thing is a breeze!
