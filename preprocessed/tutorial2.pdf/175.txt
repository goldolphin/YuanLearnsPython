【PG】151 CHAPTER  13 Functions
How many is too many?
I said before that you can pass as many arguments as you want to a function. That is true, 
but if your function has more than five or six arguments, it might be time to think of doing 
things another way. One thing you can do is collect all the arguments in a list and then pass 
the list to the function. That way, you’re passing a single variable (the list variable), which 
just happens to contain a bunch of values. It might make your code easier to read. 

【PG】Functions that return a value
So far, our functions have just been doing stuff for us. But a very useful thing about func -
tions is that they can also send you something back.
You have seen that you can send information (arguments) to functions, but functions can 
also send information back to the caller. The value that comes back from a function is called 
the result  or return value .CALLERARGUMENTSFUNCTION
