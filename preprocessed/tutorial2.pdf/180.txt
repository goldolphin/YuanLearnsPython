【PG】156 Hello World!

【PG】try to change the global variable inside the function, you get a new, local variable instead. 
Try running it and see.

【PG】def calcula teTax(price, tax_ra te):
    total = price + (price * tax_ra te)  
   
    my_price = 10000       
    prin t "my_price (inside func tion) = " , my_price  
    return total      
                                        
【PG】my_price = floa t(raw_inpu t ("Enter a price: " ))
totalPrice = calcula teTax(my_price, 0.06)                   
prin t "price = " , my_price, " To tal price = " , totalPrice              
prin t "my_price (ou tside func tion) = " , my_price

【PG】As you can see, there are now two different variables called my_price , with different values. 
One is the local variable  inside the calculateTax()  function that we set to 10,000. The other 
is the global variable  we defined in the main program to capture the user’s input, which was 
7.99.

【PG】Forcing a global
In the last section, you saw that, if you try to change the value of a global variable  from 
inside a function, Python creates a new local variable  instead. This is meant to prevent 
functions from accidentally changing global variables.
However, there are times when you want  to change a global variable from inside a function. 
So how do you do it?

【PG】Python has a keyword, global , that lets you do that. You use it like this:

【PG】Listing 13.7 Trying to modify a global variable inside a function 
>>> ========================== RESTART ==========================
>>> 
Enter a price: 7.99
my_price (inside func tion) =  10000
price =  7.99  To tal price =  8.4694
my_price (ou tside func tion) =  7.99
def calcula teTax(price, tax_ra te):
    global my_price Modifies my_price 
inside the function Prints the local 
version of my_price
The variable 
my_price 
here is a 
different 
chunk of 
memory 
than the 
my_price 
herePrints the global 
version of my_price
Prints my_price from 
inside the function
Prints my_price from 
outside the function
Tells Python you want to use 
the global version of my_price
