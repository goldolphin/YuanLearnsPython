【PG】75 CHAPTER  7 Decisions, Decisions

【PG】This line 
means the same as this one:
In both cases, the block executes if the age is 8 or higher, and it doesn’t if the age is lower 
than 8.

【PG】In chapter 4, you saw math operators  like +, -, *, and /. In this chapter, you saw the 
comparison operators  <, >, ==, and so on. The and, or, and not keywords are also operators. 
They’re called logical operators . They’re used to modify comparisons by combining two 
or more of them ( and, or) or reversing them ( not).

【PG】Table 7.1 lists all the operators we’ve talked about so far.

【PG】Table 7.1 List of math and comparison operators
Operator Name What it does
Math operators
= Assignment Assigns a value to a name (variable).
+ Addition Adds two numbers together. This can also be used to concatenate strings.
- Subtraction Subtracts two numbers.
+= Increment Adds one to a number.
-= Decrement Subtracts one from a number.
* Multiplication Multiplies two numbers together.
/ Division Divides two numbers. If both numbers are integers, the result will be just 
the integer quotient, with no remainder.
% Modulus Gets the remainder (or modulus ) for integer division of two numbers.
** Exponentiation Raises a number to a power. Both the number and the power can be 
integers or floats.
Comparison operators
== Equality Checks whether two things are equal.
< Less than Checks whether the first number is less than the second number.
> Greater than Checks whether the first number is greater than the second number.
<= Less than or equal 
toChecks whether the first number is less than or equal to the 
second number.
>= Greater than or 
equal toChecks whether the first number is greater than or equal to the 
second number.
!=
<>Not equal to Checks whether two things are not equal. (Either operator can be used.)
