【PG】Hello World!

【PG】You’ll see a window like the one in the next figure. The title bar says Untitled  because you 
haven’t given the file a name yet. 

【PG】Now, type the program in the following listing into the editor.

prin t "I love pizza!"
prin t "pizza " * 20
prin t "yum " * 40
prin t "I'm full."

【PG】When you’re done, save the program using the 
File > Save  or File > Save As  menu option. Call the file 
pizza.py . You can save it wherever you like (as long 
as you remember where it is, so you can find it later). You might want to create a new folder 
for saving your Python programs. The .py part at the end of the filename is important, 
because it tells your computer that this is a Python program and not just any old text file.

【PG】You might have noticed that the editor used some different colors in the program. Some 
words are in orange, and others are in green. This is because the IDLE editor assumed that 
you would be typing in a Python program. For Python programs, the IDLE editor shows 
Python keywords in orange and anything in quotation marks in green. This is meant to help 
you read your Python code more easily.

【PG】Running your first program

【PG】Once you’ve saved your program, go to the Run  menu (still in the IDLE editor), and pick Run 
Module  (as shown in the next figure). This will run your program.

【PG】Listing 1.1Our first real program

Notice the title that says“Listing 1.1”? When the examplecode makes a complete Pythonprogram, I will number it likethis, so you can easily ﬁnd it in the\examples folderor on the web site.
