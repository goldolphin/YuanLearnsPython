【PG】Note to parents and teachers
Python is free, open source software, and there is no danger in installing and using it on 
your computers. You can get the Python software—and everything else you need to use 
this book—for free at www.helloworldbook2.com . The download files are simple to install 
and use and are free of viruses and spyware.

【PG】Books like this used to come with CDs with all the software on them, but now most readers 
(and publishers) prefer to use the Internet. If you can’t download the software from the 
book’s web site, Manning can send you a CD containing the same files available on the web 
site. There’s no cost for the CD, but you’ll have to pay the shipping and handling fee based 
on your address. 

【PG】To get the CD, send an email to support@manning.com with the subject line “Hello World! 
2nd Edition CD. ” Or you can send a good, old-fashioned letter to:
Hello World 2nd Edition CD Request
