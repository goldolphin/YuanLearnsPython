【PG】126 Hello World!

【PG】What happened here? Well, we said before that append()  adds one item to a list. How did it 
add three? It didn’t. It added one item, which happens to be another list containing three items. 
That’s why we got the extra set of square brackets inside our list. Remember that a list can 
hold anything, including other lists. That’s what we’ve got.

【PG】insert()  works the same way as append() , except that you tell it where to put the new 
item. append()  always puts it at the end.

【PG】Deleting from a list

【PG】How do you delete or remove things from a list? There are three ways: remove() , del, 
and pop() .

【PG】Deleting with remove()

【PG】remove()  deletes the item you choose from the list and throws it away:
You don’t need to know where in the list the item is. You just need to know it’s there 
somewhere. If you try to remove something that isn’t in the list, you’ll get an error:
So how can you find out if a list contains a certain item? That’s coming right up. First, let’s 
look at the other ways to delete something from a list.

【PG】Deleting with del

【PG】del lets you delete an item from the list using its index, like this:
Here, we deleted the fourth item (index 3), which was the letter d.>>> le tters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
>>> le tters.remove( 'c')
>>> prin t letters
['a', 'b', 'd', 'e']
>>> le tters.remove( 'f')
Traceback (mos t recen t call las t):
  File "<pyshell#32>", line 1, in <module>
    le tters.remove('f')
ValueError: lis t.remove(x): x no t in lis t
>>> le tters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
>>> del letters[3]
>>> prin t letters
['a', 'b', 'c', 'e']
