【PG】69 CHAPTER  7 Decisions, Decisions
Testing or checking is also called comparing . The double equal sign is called a comparison 
operator . Remember, we talked about operators  in chapter 3. An operator is a special symbol 
that operates on the values around it. In this case, the operation is to test whether the 
values are equal.

【PG】Other kinds of tests
Lucky for us, the other comparison operators are easier to remember: less than ( <), greater 
than (>), and not equal to ( !=). (You can also use <> for not equal to, but most people use 
!=.) You can also combine > or < with = to make greater than or equal to ( >=) and less than 
or equal to ( <=). You might have seen some of these in math class.

【PG】You can also chain two greater-than or less-than operators together to make an in-between 
test, like this:
if 8 < age < 12:

【PG】Mixing up = and == is one of the most common mistakes in programming. Several languages use 
these symbols (not just Python), and lots of programmers use the wrong one in the wrong place 
every day.

【PG】Not equal
In Python 3, the <> syntax for not equal to  is no longer supported. In 
Python 3, you have to use != for not equal to .
