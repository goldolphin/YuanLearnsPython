【PG】340 Hello World!

【PG】If you run this code, you should get something like this:
If you look at the totals, you can see that all the numbers came up roughly the same 
number of times, between 80 and 100. They didn’t come up exactly the same number of 
times because the numbers are random, but they’re close, and there’s no obvious pattern 
of some numbers coming up much more often than others. Try running the program a few 
times to make sure. Or try increasing the number of loops to 10,000 or 100,000.

【PG】Now let’s try the same thing with two 6-sided dice. The following code does that.
impor t random
totals = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
for i in range(1000):
    die_1 = random.randin t(1, 6)
    die_2 = random.randin t(1, 6)
    dice_ total = die_1 + die_2
    totals[dice_ total] += 1
    
for i in range (2, 13):
    prin t "total", i, "came up" , totals[i], "times"

【PG】If you run the code in listing 23.2, you should get output that looks something like this:total 2 came up 95 times
total 3 came up 81 times
total 4 came up 85 times
total 5 came up 86 times
total 6 came up 100 times
total 7 came up 85 times
total 8 came up 94 times
total 9 came up 98 times
total 10 came up 93 times
total 11 came up 84 times
total 12 came up 99 times
