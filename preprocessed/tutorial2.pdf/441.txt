【PG】417  APPENDIX  B Differences Between Python 2 and 3
Python 2 does floor division  by default. Python 3 does floating-point division  by default. So in 
Python 3 you get
If you want floor division in Python 3, you can get that by using a double slash, like this:
The modulus operator ( %) to get the remainder in integer division works the same in Python 
3 as in Python 2:
Python 2:
Python 3:

【PG】range()
In Python2, the range()  function returns a list. But in Python 3, range()  returns a range 
object . For purposes of looping, a range object in Python 3 works basically the same way as 
a list in Python 2. But if you try to print it, you don’t see the individual values in the range:
Python 2:
Python 3:

【PG】Python 2 to 3 conversion
There is a tool called 2to3  that attempts to automatically convert Python 2 code to Python 3 
code. If you’re running Python 3, you can try it on some of the listings in this book. Many of 

>>> prin t(5/2)
2.5
>>> prin t(5//2)
2
>>> prin t 5%2
1
>>> prin t(5%2)
1
>>> prin t range(5)
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> prin t(range(5))

【PG】range(0, 5)
