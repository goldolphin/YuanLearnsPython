【PG】311 CHAPTER  21 Print Formatting and Strings

【PG】In this case, we stripped the “de” off the end of my name. If there were no “de” at the end, 
nothing would be stripped off:

【PG】If you don’t tell strip()  what to strip off, it’ll strip off any whitespace. Like we said before, 
that includes spaces, tabs, and newlines. So if we had extra spaces to get rid of, we could 
do this:
Notice that the extra spaces after my name were removed. The good thing is that you don’t 
need to tell strip()  how many spaces to remove. It’ll remove all whitespace at the end of 
the string. 

【PG】Changing case
I want to show you two more string methods. They are for changing the case of a string 
from uppercase to lowercase or vice versa. Sometimes you want to compare two strings like 
“Hello” and “hello” , and you want to know if they have the same letters, even if the case is 
not the same. One way to do this is to make all the letters in both strings lowercase and 
then do the comparison.
Python has a string method for that. It’s called lower() . Try this in interactive mode:
There is a similar method called upper() :

【PG】You can make all-lowercase (or all-uppercase) copies of your original strings and then 
compare the copies to check if they are the same, ignoring case.>>> name = 'Bar t Simpson'
>>> shor t_name = name.s trip('de')
>>> shor t_name
'Bar t Simpson'
>>> name = "Warren Sande     " 
>>>> shor t_name = name.s trip()
>>> shor t_name
'Warren Sande'
>>> s tring1 = "Hello"
>>> s tring2 = s tring1.lower()
>>> prin t string2 
hello
>>> s tring3 = s tring1.upper()
>>> prin t string3
HELLO

at the end of my name?
