【PG】Chapter 8 Loop the Loop
or game controller, process that input, and 
update the screen. When we start writing these 
kinds of programs, we’ll be using lots of loops. 
There’s a good chance one of our programs 
will get stuck in a loop at some point, so we 
need to know how to get it unstuck!

【PG】What are the square brackets for?
You might have noticed that the list of loop values is enclosed in square brackets. The 
square brackets and the commas between the numbers are the way you make a list in 
Python. You’ll learn more about lists soon (in chapter 12, to be exact). But for now, just 
know that a list is a kind of “container” for storing a bunch of things together. In this case, 
the things are numbers—the values that looper  takes as it goes through different iterations 
of the loop. 

【PG】Using a counting loop
Now let’s do something a bit more useful with loops. Let’s print a multiplication table. It 
only takes a small change to our program. Here’s the new version.
for looper in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
    prin t looper, "times 8 =" , looper * 8
Save it as Loop3.py , and run it. You should see something like this:Listing 8.3 Printing the 8 times table
>>> =================== RESTART ===================
>>> 
1 times 8 = 8
2 times 8 = 16
3 times 8 = 24
4 times 8 = 32
5 times 8 = 40
