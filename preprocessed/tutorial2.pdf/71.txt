【PG】raw_input()
The raw_input()  function gets a string from the user. The normal way it gets this is from 
the keyboard—the user types in the input.
raw_input()  is another one of Python’s built-in functions, like str() , int() , float() , and 
type() . (You saw those in chapter 4.) You’ll learn a lot more about functions later. But for 
now, you just need to remember to include the parentheses (round brackets) when you use 
raw_input() . 

【PG】Here is how you use it:
This will let the user type in a string and assign it the name someName . 

【PG】Now let’s put this into a program. Create a new file in IDLE, and type in the code in the fol -
lowing listing.
prin t "Enter your name: "
somebody = raw_inpu t()
prin t "Hi", somebody, "how are you today?"
Save and run this program in IDLE to see how it works. You should see something like this: 
I typed in my name, and the program assigned it the name somebody . someName = raw_inpu t()

【PG】In Python 3, the raw_input()  function is called input() . It works 
exactly the same way as raw_input()  in Python 2.
