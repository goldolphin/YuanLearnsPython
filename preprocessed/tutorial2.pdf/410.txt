【PG】386 Hello World!

【PG】You’ll see why this order matters soon.

【PG】To keep track of which way the skier is facing, we use a variable called angle . This has values from -2 to +2, as follows:
■-2 = Turning sharp left 
■-1 = Turning a little left
■ 0 = Going straight down
■+1 = Turning a little right
■+2 = Turning sharp right
(Note that right  and left refer to screen right and left, as we see them, not the skier’s right and left.)

【PG】We use the value of angle  to know which image to use. In fact, we can directly use the value of angle  as the index to the list of images:
■skier_images[0]  is the one where he’s going straight down. 
■skier_images[1]  is the one where he’s turning a little right.
■skier_images[2]  is the one where he’s turning sharp right.

【PG】Now comes the tricky part. Remember in Chapter 12, when we talked about lists, that we said that a negative list index will wrap around and start counting backward from the end of the list? So, in this case

■skier_images[-1]  is the one where he is turning a little left (this would usually be called skier_images[4] ).
■skier_images[-2]  is the one where he is turning sharp left (this would usually be called skier_images[3] ).

【PG】Now you can see why we arranged the images in the list in that specific order:
■angle  = +2 (turning sharp right) = skier_images[2]
■angle  = +1 (turning a little right) = skier_images[1]
■angle  = 0 (going straight down) = skier_images[0]
■angle  = -1 (turning a little left) = skier_images[-1]  (also known as skier_images[4] )
■angle  = -2 (turning sharp left)  = skier_images[-2]  (also known as skier_images[3] )
