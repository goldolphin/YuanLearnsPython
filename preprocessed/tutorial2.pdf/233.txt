【PG】CHAPTER 16 Graphics
You already saw the first part. We drew the ball in a new position. Now we have to erase the 
ball from where it was before. But what does “erasing” really mean?

【PG】Erasing images
When you draw something on paper or on a blackboard, it’s easy to erase it. You just use an 
eraser, right? But what if you made a painting? Let’s say you made a painting of blue sky, 
and then you painted a bird in the sky. How would you “erase” the bird? You can’t erase 
paint. You’d have to paint some new blue sky over where the bird was. 
Computer graphics are like paint, not like pencil or chalk. In order to “erase” something, 
what you really have to do is “paint over” it. But what do you paint over it with? In the case 
of your sky painting, the sky is blue, so you’d paint over the bird with blue. Our background 
is white, so we have to paint over the beach ball’s original image with white.

【PG】Let’s try that. Modify your program from listing 16.11 to match the following listing. There’s 
only one new line to add.
import pygame, sys
pygame.init()
screen = pygame.display.set_mode([640,480])
screen.fill([255, 255, 255])
my_ball = pygame.image.load( 'beach_ball.png' )
screen.blit(my_ball,[50, 50])
pygame.display.flip()
pygame.time.delay(2000)
screen.blit(my_ball, [150, 50])
pygame.draw.rect(screen, [255,255,255], [50, 50, 90, 90], 0)
pygame.display.flip()
running = True
while running:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT: 
            running = False
pygame.quit()

【PG】We added line 10 to draw a white rectangle over the first beach ball. The beach ball image 
is about 90 pixels wide by 90 pixels high, so that’s how big we made the white rectangle. If 
you run the program in listing 16.12, it should look like the beach ball moves from its origi -
nal location to the new location.

【PG】What’s under there?
Painting over our white background (or the blue sky in your painting) is fairly easy. But what 
if you painted the bird on a cloudy sky? Or on a background of trees? Then you’d have to
