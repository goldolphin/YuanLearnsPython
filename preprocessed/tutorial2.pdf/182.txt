【PG】What variable scope is, and what local and global variables are

【PG】How to use global variables in a function

【PG】Test your knowledge

1What keyword do you use to create a function?
2How do you call a function?
3How do you pass information (arguments) to a function?
4What’s the maximum number of arguments a function can have?
5How do you get information back from a function?
6What happens to local variables in a function after the function is finished running?

【PG】Try it out

1Write a function to print your name in big letters, like this:
Write a program that calls the function a number of times.
2Make a function that will allow you to print any name, address, street, city, state or 
province, zip or postal code, and country in the world. (Hint: It needs seven 
arguments. You can pass them as individual arguments or as a list.)
3Try using the example from listing 13.7, but making my_price  global so you can see 
the difference in the resulting output.
4Write a function to calculate the total value of some change—quarters, dimes, nickels, 
and pennies (just like in the last “Try it out” question from chapter 5). The function 
should return the total value of the coins. Then write a program that calls the function. 
The output should look like this when it runs: CCCC       A       RRRRR  TTTTTTT  EEEEEE  RRRRR
 C    C     A A      R    R    T     E       R    R
C          A   A     R    R    T     EEEE    R    R
C         AAAAAAA    RRRRR     T     E       RRRRR
 C    C  A       A   R    R    T     E       R    R
  CCCC  A         A  R    R    T     EEEEEE  R    R
quar ters: 3
dimes: 6
nickels: 7
pennies: 2
total is $1.72
