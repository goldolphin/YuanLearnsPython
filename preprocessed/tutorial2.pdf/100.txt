3What kind of if statement would you use to check if a number was greater than 30 
but less than or equal to 40?

【PG】Try it out 
1A store is having a sale. It’s giving 10% off purchases of $10 or lower, and 20% off 
purchases of greater than $10. Write a program that asks the purchase price and 
displays the discount (10% or 20%) and the final price.
2A soccer team is looking for girls from ages 10 to 12 to play on their team. Write a 
program to ask the user’s age and whether the user is male or female (using “m” or 
“f”). Display a message indicating whether the person is eligible to play on the team.
Bonus: Make the program so that it doesn’t ask for the age unless the user is a girl.
3You’re on a long car trip and arrive at a gas station. It’s 200 km to the next station. 
Write a program to figure out if you need to buy gas here, or if you can wait for the 
next station.
The program should ask these questions:

【PG】my_number = 7
if my_number < 20:
    prin t 'Under 20'
