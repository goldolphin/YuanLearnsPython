【PG】Chapter 2 Remember This: Memory and Variables

【PG】There are other kinds of things in Python that can be changed. You will learn more about 
this in chapter 12, when we talk about lists.

【PG】The new me
You can also make a variable equal to itself:
I bet you’re thinking, “Well, that’s pretty useless!” And you’d be right. It’s kind of like saying 
“I am me. ” But with a small change, you can become a whole new you ! Try this:
What happened here? In the first line, the Score  tag was stuck on the value 7. We made a 
new thing, which was Score + 1 , or 7 + 1. That new thing is 8. Then we took the Score  tag 
off the old thing (7) and stuck it on the new thing (8). So Score  has been reassigned from 
7 to 8. 

【PG】Whenever you make a variable equal something, the variable always appears on the left 
side of the equal sign ( =). The trick is that the variable can also appear on the right. This 
turns out to be quite useful, and you’ll see it in a lot of programs. The most common use is 
to increment  a variable (increase it by a certain amount), like we just did, or the opposite, to 
decrement  a variable (decrease it by a certain amount):

【PG】1Start with Score  = 7. 
2Make a new thing by adding 1 to it 
(which makes 8). 
3Give the name Score  to the new thing. 
So, Score  changed from 7 to 8.

【PG】Here are a couple of important things to remember about variables:
■A variable can be reassigned (the tag can be stuck on a new thing) at any time by a
program. This is very important to remember, because one of the most common
“bugs” in programming is changing the wrong variable, or changing the right variable
at the wrong time. >>> Score = 7
>>> Score = Score
>>> Score = Score + 1
>>> prin t Score

from 7 to 8
