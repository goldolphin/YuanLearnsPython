【PG】48 Hello World!

【PG】The print command and the comma

【PG】Usually, when you want input from the user, you have to tell him what you are looking for, with a short message like this: 

【PG】Then you can get his response with the raw_input() function: 

【PG】When you run those code lines and type in your name, it looks like this: 

【PG】If you want the user to type his answer on the same line as the message, just put a comma at the end of the print statement, like this: 

【PG】Notice that the comma goes outside the end quotes. 

【PG】If you run this code, it will look like this: 

【PG】The comma can be used to combine a number of print statements on one line. The comma really means “don’t jump down to the next line after you print this. ” We did that in the last line of listing 5.1. Try typing the following code into an IDLE editor window and running it. 

【PG】print "My", 
print "name", 
print "is", 
print "Dave." 

【PG】You should get this when you run it: prin t "Enter your name: " 
someName = raw_inpu t() 
Enter your name: 
Warren 
prin t "Enter your name: ", 
someName = raw_inpu t() 
Enter your name: Warren 

【PG】Listing 5.2 What does the comma do? 

【PG】My name is Dave.
