【PG】 448 Hello World!

【PG】 Rolling an 11-sided die is different from rolling two 6-sided dice because, with an 
11-sided die, all numbers from 2 to 12 have an equal probability of coming up. 
With two 6-sided dice, some numbers (totals of the two dice) will come up more 
often than others.

【PG】 Here are two ways to simulate rolling a die in Python: and

【PG】 To represent a single card, we used an object.

【PG】 To represent a deck of cards, we used a list. Each item in the list was one card (an 
object).

【PG】 To remove a card from a deck or a hand, we used the remove()  method for lists, like 
this: deck.remove()  or hand.remove() .

【PG】 Just try it and see what happens.

Computer simulations are used for a number of reasons:
■To save money (to do experiments that would be too expensive to do in the real 
world).
■To protect people and equipment (to do experiments that would be too dangerous 
in the real world).
■To try things that simply aren’t possible in the real world (like making a big asteroid 
crash into the Moon).
■To speed up time (to make an experiment go faster than it would in the real world). 
This is good for studying things that take a long time, like glaciers melting.
■To slow down time (to make an experiment go slower than it would in the real 
world). This is good for studying things that happen very fast, like electrons zipping 
down a wire.
