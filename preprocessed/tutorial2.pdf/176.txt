【PG】152 Hello World!

【PG】Returning a value
The way you make a function return a value is to use the Python return  keyword inside the function. Here’s an example:
This will send the value taxTotal  back out to the part of the program that called the function.

【PG】But when it’s sent back, where does it go? 
Returned values go back to whatever code called the function. Here’s an example: 
The calculateTax  function will return the value 8.4694, and that value will be assigned to totalPrice.

【PG】You can use a function to return values anywhere you’d use an expression. 
You can assign the return value to a variable (as we just did), use it in another expression, or print it, like this:
You can also do nothing with the returned value, like this: 
In the last example, the function ran and calculated the total with tax, but we didn’t use the result.

【PG】Let’s make a program with a function that returns a value. 
In listing 13.4, the calculateTax() function returns a value. We give it the price before tax and the tax rate, and it returns the price after tax. We’ll assign this value to a variable. So instead of just using the function’s name like we did before, we need a variable, an equal sign ( =), and then the function’s name. The variable will be assigned the result that the calculateTax() function gives back.
def calculateTax(price, tax_rate):
    taxTotal = price + (price * tax_rate)
    return taxTotal
totalPrice = calculateTax(7.99, 0.06)

【PG】>>> print calculateTax(7.99, 0.06)
8.4694
>>> total = calculateTax(7.99, 0.06) + calculateTax(6.59, 0.08)
>>> calculateTax(7.49, 0.07)
