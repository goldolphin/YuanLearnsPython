【PG】122 Hello World!

【PG】back is always the difference between the two index numbers. (4 – 1 = 3, and we got three 
items back.)

【PG】Here’s one other thing that is important to remember about slicing a list: What you get back 
when you slice a list is another (usually smaller) list. This smaller list is called a slice of the 
original list. The original list isn’t changed. The slice is a partial copy  of the original.

【PG】Look at the difference here:
In the first case, we got back an item. In the second case, we got back a list containing the 
item. It’s a subtle difference, but you need to know about it. In the first case, we used a 
single index to get one item  out of the list. In the second case, we used slice notation  to get 
a one-item slice  of the list.

【PG】To really see the difference, try this:>>> print letters[1]
b
>>> print letters[1:2]
['b']
>>> print type(letters[1])
<type 'str'>
>>> print type(letters[1:2])

【PG】<type 'list'>
