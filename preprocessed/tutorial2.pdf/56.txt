【PG】32 Hello World!

【PG】But what if 
I want the 2 + 3 
to go first?

【PG】If we do the multiplication first, we get 
3 * 4 = 12, so then 2 + 12 = 14
The correct order is the second one, so the correct answer is 14. In math, there is something 
called the order of operations  that tells you which operators should be done before others, 
even if they are written down after them.

【PG】In our example, even though the + sign comes before the * sign, the multiplication is done 
first. Python follows proper math rules, so it does multiplication before addition. We can try 
this in interactive mode to make sure:
The order that Python uses is the same one you learned (or will learn) in math class. Expo -
nents come first, then multiplication and division, and then addition and subtraction. 
If you want to change the order of operations and make
something go first, you just put parentheses  (round brackets) 
around it, like this:

【PG】This time, Python did the 2 + 3 first (because of the 
parentheses) to get 5, and then it multiplied 5 * 4 to get 20.
Again, this is exactly 
the same as in math 
class. Python (and all 
other programming 
languages) follow 
proper math rules 
and the order of 
operations.

【PG】>>> prin t 2 + 3 * 4
14
>>> prin t (2 + 3) * 4
20

【PG】You with the brackets! Come to 
the front. I’ll take you first.
