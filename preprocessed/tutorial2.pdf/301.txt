【PG】Chapter 20 More GUIs
She’s a real beauty, ain’t she?
She can do zero to zero 
in 1 second flat. It looks a little confusing, but if you take a closer look, you’ll see the part that describes the 
window and the part that describes the button, as well as some other parts we haven’t 
talked about yet, like the menu and status bar.

【PG】Making our GUI do something
We now have a very basic GUI—a window with a button. But it 
doesn’t do anything. We haven’t written any code to tell the 
program what to do when someone clicks 
the button. It’s like having a car with 
four wheels and a body, but no engine. 
It looks nice, but it won’t go anywhere.
We need a little bit of code to make our 
program run. For a PyQt program, the mini -
mum you need is something like this.
impor t sys
from PyQt4 impor t QtCore, Q tGui, uic  
form_class = uic.loadUiType( "MyFirs tGui.ui")[0] 
class MyWindowClass(Q tGui.QMainWindow, form_class):                
    def __ini t__(self, paren t=None):            
        Q tGui.QMainWindow.__ini t__(self, paren t)                
        self.se tupUi(self)                      
app = Q tGui.QApplica tion(sys.argv)  
myWindow = MyWindowClass() 
myWindow.show()                
app.exec_()

【PG】The reason for the [0] at the end of the line that loads the UI is that the uic.loadUiType()
 method returns a list with two things in it: something called aform_class and something called abase_cla ss. For our purposes, we only need the ﬁrst item, theform_class, whichisitem[0] in the list.
