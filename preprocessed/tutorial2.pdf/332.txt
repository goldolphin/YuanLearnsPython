【PG】308 Hello World!
【PG】Searching for strings
【PG】Suppose you want to make a program for your mom that takes recipes and displays them in 
a GUI. You want to put the ingredients in one place and the instructions in another. Let’s 
imagine that the recipe looks something like this:
【PG】Assume that the lines of the recipe are in a list, and that each line is a separate item in the 
list. How would you find the “Instructions” section? Python has a couple of methods that 
would help you.

【PG】The startswith()  method tells you whether a string starts with a certain character or 
characters. An example is the easiest way to show this. Try this in interactive mode:

The name Frankenstein starts with the letter 
F, so the first one was True . The name 
Frankenstein starts with the letters Frank , 
so the second one was True . The name 
Frankenstein does not start with Flop , so that 
one was False .

Because the startswith()  method returns 
a True  or False  value, you can use it in 
comparisons or if statements, like this:

【PG】Chocola te Cake

2 eggs

>>> name.s tartswith("Frank")
True
>>> name.s tartswith("Flop")
False
>>> if name.s tartswith("Frank"):
        prin t "Can I call you Frank?"Can I call 
you Frank?
