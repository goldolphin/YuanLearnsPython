【PG】414 Hello World!

【PG】I recommend that you not use the underscore character at the beginning or end of a variable name unless you know exactly why you’re using it. In some situations, using the underscore character at the beginning or end of an identifier has a special meaning. So avoid this:
■_first_number = 15
■student_name_ = "John"

【PG】Here are some examples of valid variable names:
■my_answer
■answer23
■answer_23
■YourAnswer
