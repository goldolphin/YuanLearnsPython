【PG】286 Hello World!

【PG】SaturnUranusNeptunePlutoyou are 
insanely 
cold!

【PG】If I enter -50 
in the Celsius box, and 
click the button, I should get 
about -58 Fahrenheit.
But it 
says 0. What's 
happening?

【PG】Hey, 
I found a 
bug!

【PG】covered it yet, so you can either skip ahead to chapter 21 to get the full explanation of how 
it works, or you can just type in the code I’ll give you here. Replace the last line of the 
btn_FtoC_clicked  event handler with these two lines:
This will display the number with two decimal places. 

【PG】Hmmm … Maybe it’s time to do some
   debugging . What if our users want to 
    convert temperatures in Antarctica?
    Or on Pluto?

【PG】Squashing a bug
We said before that one good way to see what’s going on in the program is to print out the 
value of some of the variables while the program is running. So let’s try that.
Because it’s the Fahrenheit value in the Celsius to Fahrenheit conversion that seems not to 
be working, we’ll start there. Add this line after the last line in the  btn_CtoF_clicked  event 
handler in listing 20.3:

【PG】Now, whenever you click the Celsius to Fahrenheit  button, you can see the cel and fahr
variables printed out in the IDLE shell window. Try it with a few different values for cel and 
see what happens. I got something like this:cel_ text = '%.2f' % cel
self.edi tCel.se tText(cel_ text) 
prin t 'cel = ' , cel, '  fahr = ' , fahr
>>> ============================ RESTART ============================
>>> 
cel =  50.0   fahr =  122.0
cel =  0.0   fahr =  32.0
cel =  -10.0   fahr =  14.0
cel =  -50.0   fahr =  -58.0
