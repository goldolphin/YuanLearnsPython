【PG】If you run the program in listing 14.2, you should see this:
Notice that after we called the bounce()  method, the ball’s direction  changed from down  to 
up, which is exactly what the code in the bounce()  method is supposed to do.

【PG】Initializing an object
When we created our ball object, it didn’t have anything filled in for the size , color , or 
direction . We had to fill those in after  we created the object. But there’s a way to set the 
properties of an object when it’s being created. This is called initializing  the object. 

【PG】Listing 14.2 Using the Ball  class
>>> ========================== RESTART ==========================
>>> 
I jus t crea ted a ball.          
My ball is small                 
My ball is red                   
My ball's direc tion is down
Now I'm going to bounce the ball
Now the ball's direc tion is up

【PG】Here’s our class, 
same as before
Makes an instance of our class
Sets some 
attributes
Prints the object’s 
attributes
Uses a method
The attributes as 
we set themNow we bounce() 
the ball
It changed direction, 
from down to up

【PG】Initializing  means “getting something ready at the start.” 
When we initialize  something in software, we make it ready to 
use by getting it into the state or condition that we want.
