【PG】Run the program, and see 
what happens. Did the ball 
move? Well, sort of. You 
should have seen two 
beach balls: 
The first one showed up in the original position, and then the second one appeared to the 
right of it a couple of seconds later. So we did move the beach ball to the right, but we 
forgot one thing. We need to erase the first ball!

【PG】Animation
When you’re doing animation with computer graphics, there are two steps to moving 
something:
1You draw the thing in its new position.
2You erase the thing from its old position.Listing 16.11 Trying to move a beach ball
