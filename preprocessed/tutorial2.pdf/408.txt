【PG】384 Hello World!
Try it out

【PG】1Add an “out of orbit” test to the Lunar Lander program. If the ship goes out the top of 
the window, and the velocity exceeds +100m/s, stop the program and display a 
message like this: “You have escaped the Moon’s gravity. No landing today!”

【PG】2Add an option for the user to play Lunar Lander again after landing the ship, without 
having to restart the program.

【PG】3Add a Pause  button to the Virtual Pet GUI. This should stop or “freeze” time for the pet, 
and it should stay frozen even when the program is not running. (Hint: This means you 
probably need to save the “paused” state in the pickle file.)
