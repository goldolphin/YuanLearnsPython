【PG】Chapter 25 Skier Explained

【PG】We make a class for the skier, which is a Pygame Sprite. The skier is always 100 pixels from 
the top of the window, and we start him in the center of the window, left-to-right, which is 
at x=320, because the window is 640 pixels wide. So his initial position is [320, 100]. The 
first part of the skier class definition looks like this:

【PG】We make a class method to turn the skier, which changes angle, loads the correct image, and 
also sets the skier’s speed. The speed has both x and y components. We only move the skier 
sprite left and right (x-speed). But the y-speed determines how fast the scenery scrolls by (how 
fast he goes “down” the hill). When he is going straight down, his downward speed is faster; 
and when he is turning, his downward speed is slower. The formula for speed looks like this:
The abs in that line of code gets the absolute value  of angle. That is, we ignore the sign 
(+ or -). For downward speed, we don’t care which direction the skier is turning, we just 
need to know how much he is turning.
The whole method for turning looks like this:

【PG】We also need a method to move the skier back and forth. This makes sure he doesn’t go 
past the edge of the window:
class SkierClass(pygame.sprite.Sprite):
    def __init__(self):
        pygame.sprite.Sprite.__init__(self)
        self.image = pygame.image.load("skier_down.png")
        self.rect = self.image.get_rect()
        self.rect.center = [320, 100]
        self.angle = 0
speed = [self.angle, 6 - abs(self.angle) * 2]

def turn(self, direction): 
        self.angle = self.angle + direction
        if self.angle < -2:  self.angle = -2
        if self.angle >  2:  self.angle =  2 
        center = self.rect.center
        self.image = pygame.image.load(skier_images[self.angle])
        self.rect = self.image.get_rect()
        self.rect.center = center
        speed = [self.angle, 6 - abs(self.angle) * 2]
        return speed

def move(self, speed):
        self.rect.centerx = self.rect.centerx + speed[0]
        if self.rect.centerx < 20:  self.rect.centerx = 20
        if self.rect.centerx > 620: self.rect.centerx = 620
