【PG】339 CHAPTER  23 Take a Chance—Randomness
【PG】That gives us a number from 1 to 6, with each number having an equal chance of 
appearing. This is just like a real die.

【PG】Another way to do the same thing is to make a list of the possible results and then use the 
choice()  function to pick one of them. Here’s how that would look:
This would do exactly the same thing as the previous example. The choice()  function 
randomly chooses an item from a list. In this case, the list is the numbers from 1 to 6.

【PG】More than one die
What if you want to simulate rolling two dice? If you’re going to add up the two dice to 
get the total, you might think of doing it this way:
After all, the total of two dice can be from 2 to 12, right? Well, yes and no. You will get a 
random number between 2 and 12, but not in the same way as adding up two random 
numbers from 1 to 6. What that code line does is like rolling one big 11-sided die, not two 
6-sided dice. But what’s the difference? That gets into a topic called probability . The easiest 
way to see the difference is to try it out and see.

【PG】Let’s roll the dice many times and keep track of how many times each total comes up. We’ll do 
that with a loop and a list. The loop will roll the dice, and the list will keep track of how many 
times each total comes up. Let’s start with the single 11-sided die, as shown in this listing.

impor t random
totals = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] 
for i in range(1000):
    dice_ total = random.randin t(2, 12)
    totals[dice_ total] += 1          
    
for i in range (2, 13):
    prin t "total", i, "came up" , totals[i], "times"

【PG】The list has indexes from 0 to 12, but we won’t use the first two, because we don’t care 
about totals 0 or 1—they’ll never happen. 

【PG】When we get a result, we add 1 to that list 
item. If the total is 7, we add one to totals[7] . So totals[2]  is the number of 2s we got, 
totals[3]  is the number of 3s we got, and so on.

【PG】impor t random
sides = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
die_1 = random.choice(sides)
two_dice = random.randin t(2, 12)
