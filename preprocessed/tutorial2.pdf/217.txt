【PG】CHAPTER  16 Graphics
When I look 
closely at a computer 
screen, I see these little 
lines. Do they separate 
the pixels?

【PG】What color  to draw it. (In this case, it’s red, which is represented by the [255,  0, 0]).
■At what location  to draw it. (In this case, it’s at  [100,  100] , which is 100 pixels down 
and 100 pixels over from the top-left corner.)
■What size to draw it. (In this case, it’s 30, which is the radius in pixels—the distance 
from the center of the circle to its outer edge.)
■The width of the line . (If width  = 0, the circle is filled in completely, as it is here.)

【PG】Now we’re going to look at these five things in more detail. 
Wow, you have good eyes! The little lines are actually the rows of 
pixels. A typical computer screen might have 768 rows of pixels, with 
each row having 1,024 pixels in it. We’d say that screen has “1024 x 768 
resolution. ” Some screens have more pixels, and some have fewer.

【PG】If I asked you to draw a picture in real life, one of your first questions would be, “What should 
I draw it on?” In Pygame, a surface  is what you draw on. The display surface  is the one you see 
on the screen. That’s the one we called screen  in listing 16.3. But a Pygame program can have 

【PG】PixelsThe word pixel is short for “picture element.” This means one 
dot on your screen or in an image. If you look at any picture 
with an image viewer and zoom in (make the image really big), 
you can see the individual pixels. Here’s a regular view of a 
photo and a zoomed-in version where you can see the pixels.
