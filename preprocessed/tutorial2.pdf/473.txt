This is a basic robot that beats CircleAI:
This robot’s strategy is to wait for CircleAI to come around the board and attack when CircleAI reaches it. I created it using my knowledge of how CircleAI works, and it wouldn’t win against other robots. As I said in the chapter, it would be much, much harder to make a robot that wins every time, even when it doesn’t know what robot it’s battling against.

class AI:
    def __init__(self):
        self.isFirstTurn = True
    def turn(self):
        if self.isFirstTurn:
            self.robot.turnLeft()
            self.isFirstTurn = False
        elif self.robot.lookInFront() == "bot":
            self.robot.attack()
        else:
            self.robot.doNothing()
