【PG】Multiline comments
Sometimes you want to use more than one line for comments. You can use several lines 
with the # character at the start of each, like this:
Multiline comments are good for making sections of your code stand out visually when you’re 
reading it. You can use them to describe what’s going on in a section of code. A multiline 
comment at the start of a program could list the author’s name, the name of the program, the 
date it was written or updated, and any other information you think might be useful.

【PG】Triple-quoted strings
There is another way to make something that acts like a multiline comment in Python. 
You can just make a triple-quoted string with no name. Remember from chapter 2 that 
a triple-quoted string is a string that can span multiple lines. So you can do this:
Because the string has no name and the program isn’t “doing” anything with the string, it 
has no effect on the way the program runs. So it acts like a comment, even though it isn’t a 
comment in strict Python terms.

【PG】#Thinking like a (Python) programmer
Some Python programmers say that you 
shouldn’t use triple-quoted strings 
(multiline strings) as comments. Personally, 
I don’t see any good reason not to. The 
reason for comments is to make your code 
more readable and understandable. If you find 
that triple-quoted strings are convenient 
for you, it’s more likely you’ll put 
comments in your code, which is a 
good thing.
