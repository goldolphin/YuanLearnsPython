【PG】227 CHAPTER  17 Sprites and Collision Detection

【PG】If you wanted the balls to bounce off each other only when the round parts of the balls 
(not the edges of the rectangles) actually touched, you’d have to use something called 
pixel-perfect collision detection . The spritecollide()  function doesn’t do this, but instead 
uses the simpler rect collision detection . 

【PG】Here’s the difference. With rect collision detection, two balls will collide when any part of 
their rectangles touch each other. With pixel-perfect collision detection, two balls will only 
collide when the balls themselves touch, like this:

【PG】Pixel-perfect collision detection is more realistic. (You haven’t felt any invisible rectangles 
around any real beach balls, have you?) But it’s more complicated to do in a program.
For most things you’ll do in Pygame, rect collision detection is good enough. Pixel-perfect 
collision detection takes more code, and it’ll make your games run slower, so only use it if 
you really, really need it. Several pixel-perfect modules are available (at least two on the
