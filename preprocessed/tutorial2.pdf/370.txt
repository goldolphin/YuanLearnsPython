【PG】346 Hello World!

【PG】We should add two more attributes to make our card object easy to use in a program. When the program needs to print the card, it’ll want to print something like “4H” or “4 of Hearts. ” For the face cards, it would be something like “JD” or “Jack of Diamonds. ” We’ll add the attributes short_name and long_name, so the program can easily print either a short or long description of the card.

【PG】Let’s make a class for a playing card. The code is shown in the next listing.

class Card:
    def __init__(self, suit_id, rank_id):
        self.rank_id = rank_id
        self.suit_id = suit_id
        if self.rank_id == 1:
            self.rank = "Ace"
            self.value = 1
        elif self.rank_id == 11:
            self.rank = "Jack"
            self.value = 10
        elif self.rank_id == 12:
            self.rank = "Queen"
            self.value = 10
        elif self.rank_id == 13:
            self.rank = "King"
            self.value = 10
        elif 2 <= self.rank_id <= 10:
            self.rank = str(self.rank_id)
            self.value = self.rank_id
        else:
            self.rank = "RankError"
            self.value = -1
            
        if self.suit_id == 1:
            self.suit = "Diamonds"
        elif self.suit_id == 2:
            self.suit = "Hearts"
        elif self.suit_id == 3:
            self.suit = "Spades"
        elif self.suit_id == 4:
            self.suit = "Clubs"
        else:
            self.suit = "SuitError"
        self.short_name = self.rank[0] + self.suit[0]
        if self.rank == '10':
            self.short_name = self.rank + self.suit[0]
        self.long_name = self.rank + " of " + self.suit
        
【PG】The error checking in the code b makes sure rank_id and suit_id are in range and that they are integers. If they aren’t, you would see something like “7 of SuitError” or “RankError of Clubs” when displaying the card in a program.
