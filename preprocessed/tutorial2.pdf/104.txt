【PG】80 Hello World!

【PG】Once I made a 
mistake in a program, 
and it kept looping 
forever! 
How can I stop 
a runaway loop?

【PG】The second line ( print "hello" ) is the block of code that Python executes each time 
around the loop. A for loop needs a block of code to tell the program what to do in each 
loop. That block  (the indented part of the code) is called the body  of the loop . (Remember, 
we talked about indenting and blocks in the last chapter.) 

【PG】Let’s try something else. Instead of printing the same thing every time, let’s make the 
program print something different every time through the loop.
for looper in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
    prin t looper
Save this as Loop2.py , and run it. The results should look like this:
This time, instead of printing “hello” five times, it printed the value of the variable looper . 
Each time through the loop, looper  takes the next value in the list.

【PG】Runaway loops
The same thing has happened to me, Carter! Run -
away loops (also called endless loops or infi -
nite loops) happen to every programmer once 
in a while. To stop a Python program at any 
time (even in a runaway loop), press 
CTRL-C . That means we press and hold down 
the CTRL  key and, while holding it down, 
press the C key. This will come in very handy 
later! Games and graphics programs are constantly running in 
a loop. They need to keep getting input from the mouse, keyboard,
