【PG】153 CHAPTER 13 Functions
【PG】def calcula teTax(price, tax_rate):           
    total = price + (price * tax_rate)    
    return total              

【PG】my_price = floa t(raw_inpu t ("Enter a price: " ))
totalPrice = calcula teTax(my_price, 0.06)  
prin t "price = " , my_price, " To tal price = " , totalPrice 

【PG】Try typing in, saving, and running the program in listing 13.4. Notice that the tax rate is 
fixed as 0.06 (which equals 6 percent tax) in the code. If the program had to handle 
different tax rates, you could have the user enter the tax rate as well as the price.

【PG】Variable scope 
You might have noticed that we have variables 
outside the function, like totalPrice , as well as 
variables inside the function, like total . These are 
just two names for the same thing. It’s like back in 
chapter 2, when we had YourTeacher = MyTeacher .
In our calculateTax  example, totalPrice  and total  are two tags attached to the same 
thing. With functions, the names inside the function are only created when the function 
runs. They don’t even exist before the function runs or after it has finished running. Python 
has something called memory management  that does this automatically. Python creates new 
names to use inside the function when it runs, and then deletes them when the function is 
finished . That last part is important: when the function is done running, any names inside it 
cease to exist.

【PG】While the function is running, the names outside  the function are sort of on hold—they’re 
not being used. Only the names inside the function are being used. The part of a program 
where a variable is used (or available to be used) is called its scope .

【PG】Local variables
In listing 13.4, the variables price  and total  were only used within the function. We say 
that price , total , and tax_rate  are in the scope  of the calculateTax()  function. Another 
term that is used is local . The price , total , and tax_rate  variables are local variables  in the 
calculateTax()  function. Listing 13.4 Creating and using a function that returns a value
and returns totalFunction
