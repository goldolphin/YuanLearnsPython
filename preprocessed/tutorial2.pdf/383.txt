【PG】b The init_cards()  function (not shown here) sets up the deck and creates the player’s 
hand (5 cards), the computer’s hand (5 cards), and the first up card.

【PG】Listing 23.11 is still not a complete program, so it will give you an error if you try to run it. 
But if you have been following along, you have almost the whole program in your editor by 
now. The complete listing for Crazy Eights is too long to print here (it’s about 200 lines of 
code, plus blank lines and comments), but you can find it in the \Examples  folder, if you 
used the book’s installer. It’s also on the web site ( www.helloworldbook2.com ). You can use 
IDLE to edit and run this program.
