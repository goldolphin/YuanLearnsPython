【PG】347 CHAPTER  23 Take a Chance—Randomness
【PG】The line that sets the short_name  simply takes the number or first letter of the rank (6 or 
Jack) and the first letter of the suit (Diamonds) and puts them together. For the King of 
Hearts, short_name  would be KH. For the 6 of Spades, it would be 6S.

【PG】Listing 23.4 isn’t a complete program. It’s just the class definition for our Card  class. Because 
this is something we could use over and over in different programs, maybe we should make 
it a module . Save the code in listing 23.4 as cards.py . 

【PG】Now we need to make some instances of cards—in fact, a whole deck would be nice! To test 
our Card  class, let’s make a program to create a deck of 52 cards and then pick 5 cards at 
random and display their attributes. Here’s some code for that. 

【PG】impor t random
from cards impor t Card 
deck = [] 
for suit_id in range(1, 5):                          
    for rank_id in range(1, 14):                     
        deck.append(Card(sui t_id, rank_id)) 
hand = []                                            
for cards in range(0, 5):                        
    a = random.choice(deck)                         
    hand.append(a)                                 
    deck.remove(a)                   
prin t    
for card in hand:
    prin t card.shor t_name, '=' ,card.long_name, "  Value:" , card.value

【PG】b The inner loop goes through each card in the suit, and the outer loop goes through each 
suit (13 cards * 4 suits = 52 cards). c Then the code picks five cards from the deck and puts 
them in a hand. It also removes the cards from the deck.

【PG】If you run the code in listing 23.5, you should get something like this:
If you run it again, you should get five different cards. And no matter how many times you 
run it, you should never get the same card twice in one hand. Listing 23.5 Making a deck of cards
7D = 7 of Diamonds   Value: 7
9H = 9 of Hear ts   Value: 9
KH = King of Hear ts   Value: 10
6S = 6 of Spades   Value: 6
KC = King of Clubs   Value: 10
