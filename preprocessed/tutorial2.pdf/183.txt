【PG】In the last few chapters, we’ve been looking at different ways of organizing data and pro-
grams and collecting things together. We have seen that lists are a way to collect variables 
(data) together, and functions  are a way to collect some code together into a unit that you 
can use over and over again. 

【PG】Objects  take the idea of collecting things 
together one step further. Objects are a way to 
collect functions and data together . This is a very 
useful idea in programming, and it’s used in 
many, many programs. In fact, if you look 
under the hood in Python, almost everything is 
an object. In programming terms, we say 
Python is object oriented . That means it’s possi -
ble (in fact, quite easy) to use objects in 
Python. It isn’t necessary  to create your own 
objects, but it makes many things easier. 

【PG】In this chapter, you’ll learn what objects are 
and how to create and use them. In later 
chapters, when you start doing graphics, you’ll 
be using objects a lot.
