【PG】The code for listing 10.1 is in the \examples\skier  folder, so if you get stuck or don’t want to 
type it all in, you can use that file. But believe it or not, you’ll learn more by typing it in than 
by just opening and looking at the listing. 

【PG】In later chapters, you’ll learn about all the keywords and techniques that are used in Skier. 
And at the end of the book, there’s a whole chapter explaining in detail how the Skier 
program works. But for now, just type it in and give it a try.
