【PG】416 Hello World!

【PG】Instead, in Python 3 you have to do this:
There are other things you can do with the end argument, but they’re rarely used. You can 
look them up in the Python 3 documentation if you want.

【PG】You might have noticed that the code coloring on print  is different in Python 3 than in Python 2. That’s because in Python 2, print  is a keyword, but in Python 3, print()  is a function.

【PG】In Python 3, the function that used to be called raw_input()  in Python 2 is now called simply input() . This is the function that returns a string and doesn’t try to do any evaluation of the input string (for example, converting it to an int or float ).

【PG】The function that was called input()  in Python 2, which does try to evaluate the input(convert it to a number if possible), doesn’t exist in Python 3.

【PG】That means instead of writing this (in Python 2)
you have to write (in Python 3)
And instead of writing (in Python 2)
you have to write (in Python 3)

【PG】Integer division
The third major change in Python 3 is how it handles integer division. Remember the “integer 
division gotcha” we talked about in chapter 2? That’s where you get this (in Python 2):
prin t("Hello", end=" ")
prin t("World! " )
your_name = raw_inpu t("Enter your name: " )
your_name = inpu t("Enter your name: " )
age = inpu t("Enter your age: " )
age  = int(inpu t("Enter your age: " ))
>>> prin t 5/2
