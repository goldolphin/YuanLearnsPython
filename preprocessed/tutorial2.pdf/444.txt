Chapter 2: Remember This—Memory and Variables
Test your knowledge
1You tell Python that a variable is a string by putting quotes around it.
2The question was, “Can you change the value that is assigned to a variable?” That 
depends what you mean by “change. ” If you do this,
then you can do
You have changed what is assigned to myAge . You have moved the myAge  tag to a dif -
ferent thing: you moved it from 10 to 11. But you didn’t actually change the 10 into an 
11. So it’s more correct to say that you can “reassign the name to a different value, ” or 
“assign a new value to the variable, ” rather than “change the value of the variable. ”
3No, TEACHER  is not the same as TEACHEr . Because variable names are case-sensitive, the 
last letter of the two variable names makes them different.
4Yes, 'Blah' and "Blah"  are the same. They are both strings, and in this case, Python 
doesn’t care which kind of quotes you use, as long as the opening and closing quotes 
around the string match.
5No, '4' is not the same as 4. The first one is a string (even though it has only one 
character) because it has quotes around it. The second one is a number.
6Answer b. 2Teacher  is not a correct variable name. Variable names in Python can’t 
start with a number.
7"10"  is a string because it has quotes around it.

prin t "My bir th da te is January 1, 1970."
prin t "My favori te color is blue."
myAge = 10
myAge = 11
>>> tempera ture = 25
