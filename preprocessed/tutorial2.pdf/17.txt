【PG】xviiAcknowledgments
This book would never have been started, much less finished, without the inspiration, initia -
tive, and support of my wonderful wife, Patricia. When we couldn’t find a suitable book to 
feed Carter’s keen interest in learning about programming, she said, “You should write one. 
It would be a great project for you two to work on together. ” As is often the case, she was 
right. Patricia has a way of bringing out the best in people. So Carter and I started thinking 
about what would be in such a book, writing chapter outlines and sample programs, and 
finding ways to make it fun and interesting. 

【PG】Once we got started, Carter and Patricia made 
sure we finished. Carter would give up bedtime stories to work on the book. And if we 
didn’t work on it for a while, I would be reminded, “Daddy, we haven’t worked on the book 
for days!” Carter and Patricia reminded me that, if you put your mind to it, you can do any -
thing. And all members of the family, including our daughter Kyra, gave up many hours of 
family time while the book was in progress. I thank all of them for their patience and loving 
support, which made this book possible.

【PG】Writing a manuscript is one thing; getting a book into people’s hands is another. This book 
would never have been published without the enthusiastic and persistent support of 
Michael Stephens at Manning Publications. Right from the start, he “got it” and agreed that 
there was a need for this kind of book. Michael’s steadfast belief in the project and his con -
tinued patience in guiding a rookie author through the process were immensely valuable 
and appreciated. 

【PG】I would also like to say a sincere thank you to all the other folks at Man -
ning who helped make this book happen, in particular Mary Piergies for patiently coordi -
nating all aspects of the production process.
