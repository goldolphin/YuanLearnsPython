【PG】206 Hello World!

【PG】I can’t play 
volleyball with the 
ball just standing 
there!

【PG】When you run this program, you should see the image of a beach ball displayed near the 
top-left corner of the Pygame window, like this: 

【PG】In listing 16.10, the only lines that are new are lines 5 and 6. Everything else you have seen 
before in listings 16.3 to 16.9. We replaced the draw  code from our previous examples with 
code that loads an image from disk and displays it.

【PG】In line 5, the pygame.image.load()  function loads the image from disk and creates an 
object called my_ball . The my_ball  object is a surface. (We talked about surfaces a few 
pages ago.) But we can’t see this surface. It’s only in memory. The only surface we can see 
is the display  surface, which is called screen.  (We created it in line 3.) Line 6 copies the 
my_ball  surface onto the screen  surface. Then display.flip()  makes it visible, just like 
we did before.

【PG】That’s okay, Carter. Pretty soon we’ll start 
    moving the ball around!
