【PG】Chapter 14 Objects

【PG】Imagine we’re making a game where the player can pick up various things along the way, like food, money, or clothing. We could make a class called GameObject. The GameObject class would have attributes like  name  (for example, “coin” , “apple” , or “hat”) and methods like pickUp() (which would add the object to the player’s collection of objects). All game objects would have these common methods and attributes.

【PG】Then, we could make a subclass for coins. The Coin class would be derived from GameObject. It would inherit the attributes and methods of GameObject, so the Coin class would automatically have a name attribute and a pickUp() method. The Coin class would also need a value attribute (how much the coin is worth) and a spend() method (so you could use the coin to buy something).

【PG】Let’s see what the code might look like for these classes:

【PG】Thinking ahead

【PG】In the last example, we didn’t put any real code in the methods, just some comments explaining what the methods would do. It’s a way of planning or thinking ahead for what you’ll add later. The actual code would depend on how the game worked. Programmers often do this as a way to organize their thoughts when they’re writing more complex code. The “empty” functions or methods are called code stubs.

【PG】If you tried to run the previous example, you’d get an error, because a function definition can’t be empty.

【PG】class GameObject:
        def __init__(self, name):
                self.name = name

        def pickUp(self, player):
                # put code here to add the object to the player's collection

【PG】class Coin(GameObject):
        def __init__(self, value):
                GameObject.__init__(self, "coin")
                self.value = value

        def spend(self, buyer, seller):
                # put code here to remove the coin from the buyer's money and
                # add it to the seller's money
