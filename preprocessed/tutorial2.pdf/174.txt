【PG】150 Hello World!

【PG】To send Carter’s letters to everyone on the street, our address-printing function will need 
two arguments: one for the name, and one for the house number. The next listing shows 
what this would look like.
def prin tMyAddress(someName, houseNum):
    prin t someName                               
    prin t houseNum,  
    prin t "Main S treet"           
    prin t "Ottawa, On tario, Canada"   
    prin t "K2M 2E9"                   
    prin t                             
    
prin tMyAddress( "Car ter Sande" , "45")                  
prin tMyAddress( "Jack Black" , "64")                     
prin tMyAddress( "Tom Green" , "22")                      
prin tMyAddress( "Todd Whi te", "36")                 

【PG】When you use multiple arguments (or parameters), you separate them with a comma, just 
like items in a list, which brings us to our next topic….Listing 13.3 Function with two arguments

【PG】There’s another term you’ll hear when talking about passing things 
to a function: parameters . Some people say that the terms argument 
and parameter are interchangeable. So you could say, 
“I passed two parameters to that function,” or 
“I passed two arguments to that function.”
Some people say that you should use argument when talking about the 
passing part (when you call the function), and parameter when 
talking about the receiving part (what is inside the function).

【PG】CALLERHere’s an 
argument 
for you!
FUNCTIONThanks for the
parameter!

【PG】As long as you use argument or parameter to talk about passing 
values to functions, programmers will know what you mean.
