【PG】CHAPTER  23 Take a Chance—Randomness

■Value —For the numbered cards (2 through 
10), this is usually the same as their rank. 
For Jack, Queen, and King, it’s usually 10, 
and for the Ace, it can be 1, 11, or some 
other value, depending on the game.

【PG】So we need to keep track of these three things, and we need to keep them together in some kind of container. A list would work, but we’d have to remember which item was which. Another way is to make a “card” object that has attributes like these:

【PG】That’s what we’ll do. We’ll also add a couple more attributes called suit_id  and rank_id : 
■suit_id  is a number from 1 to 4 for the suit, where 
1 = Diamonds, 2 = Hearts, 3 = Spades, 4 = Clubs
■rank_id  is a number from 1 to 13, where 
1 = Ace 
2 = 2 
3 = 3
 … 
10 = 10
11 = Jack 
12 = Queen
13 = King

【PG】The reason for adding these two attributes is so that we can easily use a nested for loop to make a deck of 52 cards. We can have an inner loop for the rank (1 to 13) and an outer loop for the suit (1 to 4). The __init__()  method for the card object will take the suit_id  and rank_id  and create the other attributes of suit, rank, and value. It also makes it easy to compare the rank of two cards to see which has the higher rank.
