【PG】423  APPENDIX  C Answers to Self-Test Questions

【PG】2In the temperature-conversion program, would these have worked?
Try them and see what happens: 
Why didn’t it work? 
Remember that everything inside the parentheses is done first. So it goes like this:
Then 
Because it goes from left to right, 5 / 9  gets done first. Because 5 and 9 are both 
integers, Python does integer division and rounds the answer down. Because the 
answer is less than 1, it gets rounded down to 0. Then 
Then 
By the time it got to float() , it was too late—the answer was already 0! The same 
goes for the second equation.

【PG】3You can “trick” int()  into rounding off instead of rounding down by adding 0.5 to the 
number you pass to int() .
Here’s an example (in interactive mode):cel = floa t(5 / 9 * (fahr - 32))
cel = 5 / 9 * floa t(fahr - 32)
>>> fahr = 75
>>> cel = floa t(5 / 9 * (fahr - 32))
>>> prin t cel
0.0
75 - 32 = 43
5 / 9 = 0
0 * 43 = 0
floa t(0) = 0.0
>>> a = 13.2
>>> roundoff = int(a + 0.5)
>>> roundoff
13
>>> b = 13.7
>>> roundoff = int(b + 0.5)
>>> b
