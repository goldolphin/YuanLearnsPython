【PG】Chapter 4 Types of Data
What did you learn?
In this chapter, you learned about
■Converting between types (or, more correctly, creating types from other types): str() , 
int() , and float()
■Displaying values directly without using print
■Checking the type of a variable using type()
■Roundoff errors and why they happen

【PG】Test your knowledge
1When you use int()  to convert a decimal number to an integer, does the result get 
rounded up or down?
2In your temperature-conversion program, would this have worked?
What about this: 
If not, why not? 
3(Extra challenging question) Without using any other functions besides int() , how 
could you get a number to round off instead of round down? (For example, 13.2 would 
round down to 13, but 13.7 would round up to 14.) 

【PG】Try it out
1Use float()  to create a number from a string like '12.34' . Make sure the result is 
really a number!
2Try using int()  to create an integer from a decimal number like 56.78 . Did the answer 
get rounded up or down?
3Try using int()  to create an integer from a string. Make sure the result is really an 
integer!cel = floa t(5 / 9 * (fahr - 32))
cel = 5 / 9 * floa t(fahr - 32)
