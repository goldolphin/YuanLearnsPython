【PG】CHAPTER  9 Just for You—Comments
The Python help that we mentioned in “Thinking like a (Python) programmer” in chapter 6 
is a kind of documentation. It’s meant to help users—like you—understand how Python 
works.

【PG】Single-line comments
You can make any line into a comment by starting it with the number sign character 
(#, sometimes called the pound sign ):
If we run these two lines, we get the following output:
The first line is ignored when the program runs. The comment, which starts with the 
# character, is only for you and other people reading the code.

【PG】End-of-line comments
You can also put comments at the end of a line of code, like this:
The comment starts at the # character. Everything before the # is a normal line of code. 
Everything after that is a comment.# This is a commen t in a Py thon program
prin t 'This is no t a commen t'
This is no t a commen t
area = leng th * wid th    # Calcula te the area of the rec tangle

【PG】Documentation
Documentation  is information about a program that describes the 
program and how it works. Comments are one part of a program’s 
documentation, but there may be other parts, outside the code 
itself, that describe things like
· why the program was written (its purpose)
· who wrote it
· who it’s meant for (its audience)
· how it’s organized
and much more. Larger, more complicated programs usually have 
more documentation.
