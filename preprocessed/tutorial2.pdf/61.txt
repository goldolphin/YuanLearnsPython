【PG】37 CHAPTER  3 Basic Math

【PG】Most programs and computer languages, including Python, let you use either 
an uppercase or a lowercase E.

【PG】For very small numbers, like 0.0000000000001752, a negative exponent is used. The scien -
tific notation would be 1.752 x 10-13, and the E-notation would be 1.752e-13. A negative 
exponent means to move the decimal place to the left instead of the right.

【PG】You can use E-notation to enter very big and very small numbers (or any number, for that 
matter) into Python. Later you’ll see how to make Python print numbers using E-notation.
Try entering some numbers in E-notation:

【PG】Although we entered the numbers in E-notation, the answer came out as a regular decimal 
number. That’s because Python won’t display numbers in E-notation unless you specifically 
tell it to, or the numbers are really big or really small (lots of zeros). 
Try this:

【PG】This time, Python displayed the answer in E-notation automatically because it wouldn’t 
make sense to display a number with 73 zeros!

【PG】If you want numbers like 14,500,000 to display in E-notation, you need to give Python 
special instructions. You’ll learn more about that later in the book (in chapter 21).
>>> a = 2.5e6
>>> b = 1.2e7
>>> prin t a + b
14500000.0
>>> c = 2.6e75
>>> d = 1.2e74
>>> prin t c + d
2.72e+7500000000000000001.752

【PG】0.00000000000011752 = 1.752e-13Move the decimal left 13 places.
