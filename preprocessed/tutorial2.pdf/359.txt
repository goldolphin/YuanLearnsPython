【PG】For simplicity, our Hangman program uses only lowercase letters. The word list we provide 
only has lowercase, and the user must enter her guesses in lowercase.

【PG】The dashes()  function b replaces the letters with dashes at the start of a new game. But it 
doesn’t replace punctuation, like apostrophes. So if the word was doesn’t , the player would 
see - - - - - ' - .

【PG】I encourage you to try creating this program on your own. You can build the GUI in Qt 
Designer. It doesn’t matter if it doesn’t look exactly the same as the version I have here. Just 
make sure you look at the code to see what names to use for the components. The names in 
the code have to match the names in the .ui file.
Type in the code if you can. Run the program and see how it works. And if you think of 
something different to try, go for it! Have fun, play around with it, and experiment. That’s one 
of the most fun and rewarding parts of programming, and it’s how you’ll learn the most.

【PG】What did you learn?

■How to use pickle  to save lists and objects (and other Python data structures) to a file

We also made a Hangman game that used data from a file to get a word list.
