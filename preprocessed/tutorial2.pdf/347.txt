【PG】323 CHAPTER 22 File Input and Output
There’s something that looks like text at the start of the .wav  file, but then it gets crazy. 
That’s because a .wav  file doesn’t have text in it, it has sound. The readline()  and 
readlines()  methods are only for reading text files.
Most of the time, if you need to use a binary file, you’ll be using something like Pygame or 
some other module to load the file, like we did in chapter 19:
In that case, Pygame takes care of opening the file and reading the binary data (which is 
music in this example). 
This book isn’t going to cover how to process binary files. But just so you know what it looks 
like, you can open a binary file by adding a b to the file mode, like this:
The 'rb'  part means you’re opening the file for reading  in binary  mode. 

【PG】In the past few sections, you have been learning how to get information from a file into 
your program, which is called reading  the file. Next you’re going to learn about getting 
information out of your program into a file. This is called writing  the file.

【PG】Writing to a file
If you want to store some information from your program more permanently, you could 
look at it on the screen and write it down on a piece of paper. But that kind of defeats the 
purpose of using a computer!
A better idea is to save the information on the hard drive, so that, even when the program 
isn’t running—in fact, even when the computer is turned off—your data is still there and 
you can get it later. You have done this many, many times already. Every time you save a 
report for school, a picture, a song, or a Python program, you’re storing it to the hard drive.
