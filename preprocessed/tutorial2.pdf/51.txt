【PG】Chapter 2 Remember This: Memory and Variables

Test your knowledge
1How do you tell Python that a variable is a string (characters) instead of a number?
2Once you have created a variable, can you change the value that is assigned to it?
3With variable names, is TEACHER  the same as TEACHEr ?
4Is 'Blah'  the same as "Blah"  to Python?
5Is '4' the same as 4 to Python?
6Which of the following is not a correct variable name? Why?
a) Teacher2
b) 2Teacher
c) teacher_25
d) TeaCher
7Is "10"  a number or a string?

Try it out
1Make a variable, and assign a number to it (any number you like). Then display your 
variable using print .
2Modify your variable, either by replacing the old value with a new value, or by adding 
something to the old value. Display the new value using print .
3Make another variable, and assign a string (some text) to it. Then display it using 
print .
4Just like in the last chapter, in interactive mode, get Python to calculate the number of 
minutes in a week. But this time, use variables. Make variables for DaysPerWeek , 
HoursPerDay , and MinutesPerHour  (or make up your own names), and then multiply 
them together.
5People are always saying there’s not enough time to get everything done. How many 
minutes would there be in a week if there were 26 hours in a day? (Hint: Change the 
HoursPerDay  variable.)
